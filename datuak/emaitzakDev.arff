'reflecting on bedazzled a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser one sinful thought remains in my mind if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley who portrays the fiery demon then use that pitchfork and point me the way with her pouty lips irresistible british accent and wild display of haute couture hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation its practically impossible to turn this beelzubabe down her next target is elliot brendan fraser a tech support geek who is clumsy awkward and just too eager to please to aptly picture him you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring steve the copy guy who effortlessly irritated his coworkers with his unpolished social skills eugene thus is loathed and feared by his coworkers who do their best to stay out of his way yet beyond his annoying mannerisms hes a lovable oaf he wishes that he could get closer to allison frances oconnor a coworker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him however the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowballs chance in hell dear god he prays i would give anything to have that girl in my life guess who then shows up she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul theres even an escape clause if elliots wish doesnt go exactly the way he likes he need only beep her one guess as to what the threedigit number is and he gets to start over the remainder of the film consists of elliots various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth power fame and allisons love but when he makes sweeping statements such as i want to be very very powerful and very very rich and married to allison hell soon learn that the devil is in the details for example and weve seen this several times in the trailers he is granted his wish but finds out that hes a columbian drug lord and that allison while married to him has her eyes on someone else apparently the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that shortcircuits his new life soon elliot wishes that he had never made that deal given the mischievous nature of the devil bedazzled has many amusing moments a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance he ably assumes various personas his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her hurley also heightens the humor quotient especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one its clear that shes having a good time with it all yet while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story but that would be playing with fire what theyve got works so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is ',?

'tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently the dalai lama has made speaking tours tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months kundun presence a name the monks call the young dalai lama opens in with the search for the th incarnation of the tibetan leader a group of monks enters a village and a twoyearold child catches their attention the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as mine he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in the peaceful and isolated country is illequipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india comparisons to seven years in tibet are inevitable both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerners point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt kundun features only native actors and is more of an insiders story in some ways this makes this film a superior concept but it lacks the movement and spark that made seven years such an audiencepleaser the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie filmed in morocco for obvious reasons the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computergenerated character on an intellectual level it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts some events are depicted differently and pitts austrian mountainclimber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lamas life isnt even mentioned here glossed over in seven years the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses we were just about to change things after the chinese attack the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain the visual treats more than make up for the movies faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience martin scorsese known for his dark tales of the underworld goodfellas taxi driver casino has shifted gears something of a thematic followup to his the last temptation of christ this is his slowest film yet oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese most of these events take place offscreen his decision to not overexplain rituals is commendable the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoonfed interpretations philip glasss score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india i was struck by what was missing in the movie as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is there is a distance between the audience and the movie the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings with the exception of a few scenes involvement with the characters is slight one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama shown as a mischievous boy who cant resist being a kid sometimes an encounter with his older brother thubten j norbu a retired indiana university professor who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment but there arent many of these even with its problems the kundun experience is phenomenal but one that i fear most will miss many people who saw seven years in tibet will have a been there done that attitude its likely that the film will miss a widespread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping ',?
'capsule the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse the idea is something about ghosts and the internet the film has an amazing apocalyptic style to perhaps the most disturbing and disturbed filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa his films all seem to have one style bleak the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold little known in the us to date his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid his film cure with one of his niftiest ideas is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with cure is probably his last year he released seance a remake of seance on a wet afternoon that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a nonsupernatural story pulse is kurosawa back on form taguchi a young computer expert is late with his delivery of some important software two coworkers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment taguchi acting very strangely lets his friends look for the missing software meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildewlike spot on the wall taguchis computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide but they are not entirely dead their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost if they say yes they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing like a computer disk instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death but whatever it does convey is nightmarish kurosawa who directs his own screenplay ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange junichiro hayashi the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawas films creates a dark cold and gloomy tone images are obscured by semilighting or are behind plastic curtain scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock but a deeper metaphysical dread of any horror filmmaker in the world kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a on the to scale and a on the to scale ',?

'well ill be damned what a most excellent surprise not to be confused with the campy and far inferior remake starring exporn star traci lords this more recent attempt at remaking the s drivein schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best scifi flick of once again bmovie king roger corman is behind this effort he directed the original but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries because its an absolute mustsee for scifi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent the plot in brief paul johnson michael york is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who though needing to kill people to live is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure the key of which lies in the blood of humans he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr rochelle whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda elizabeth barondes to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires but before long amanda and johnsons sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric i must admit my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech the dapper clothes and cool spectacles the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character york is by turns hilarious menacing and tragic this is a tourdeforce and quite simply the best performance ive seen from him and while obviously made on a modest budget the film boasts enormous strengths the casting is spot on the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent witty and consistently engaging cleverly updating the original the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect a marked contrast to the earlier remake from the film doesnt drag for a second of its minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of littleknown director terrance h winkless and it doesnt matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy this is schlock after all even if it is high schlock in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their lifethreatening situation but these are minor complaints just see it not of this earth is one of the biggest scifi surprises in years and michael york in one cool swoop youve made yourself a bmovie legend dude ',?
'i swear i have seen the edge before in fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various films mixed into an entirely different film however the edge has done something that most action films should do and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot in doing so the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than say the peacemaker unfortunately because of those overused moments we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head one surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre intelligence even horror films have learned this a genre which is probably the least respected of them all the river wild was one of the best actionsuspense films i have seen from the s the intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day the edge has the intelligence and smart characters but this time the lack of originality is the downfall i must admit that it was very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes this is an example of the final act saving the film instead of the other way around as in the lost world if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes intensity it could have become a great action film and i use the term loosely the edge is pretty much a survivalofthefittest film but taking screams lead the edge makes fun of the genres cliches and then uses them though not quite as effectively charles morse anthony hopkins is the main character a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him for once we dont immediately care for the main character instead we like bob alec baldwin a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic charles birthday is the same day and he receives a gold watch from his wife and a pocket knife from bob as action films go these items do have importance to the rest of the story but quite a bit more than we first expect soon however bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his personality charles bob bobs assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off to find him and as shown in the previews hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter down the plane goes the pilot is killed and the three are left to survive in the wilderness director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film take for instance the entire manhunting bear plot this has been done many times in films with different animals and even bears but given the charles intelligence and bobs uncertainty many of the cliches are given fresh twists even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before my favorite line of the film comes from charles most people die in the wilderness because they didnt do the one thing that could save their life thinking despite the predictability of the main plot a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise and made me smile when i realized that everything isnt as it seems anymore i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise so instead i will avoid it entirely the first twothirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along and some of charles survival techniques seem possible even making fire from ice tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the characters lose all sensibility i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while thankfully we already have begun to care for the characters and so we let this small detail slide but some of the technical details are awkward such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needles the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature and borders on phenomenal anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game baldwin can be a good or a bad character and here he succeeds at both in a way you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end and baldwin is able to handle the doublenatured photographer elle macpherson gives a good performance albeit slight she isnt in the film all that much but for the scenes she does have she handles as an actress not as a model harold perrineau is a good actor and his scenes are nice and underplayed he is eliminated early and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable the edge is rated r for graphic violence some gore and language some of the violence is a little too disturbing even for me this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to but too many cliches bog it down director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts david mamets script though has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid the best thing about the script is the ending which doesnt end with the normal highstrung action sequence but with a small detail involving a certain gift its a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear and by the way most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear way to go bart ',?

'let me open this one with a confession i love cop movies i adore them with such an unwavering near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers steven was it any good well just about as good as baldwins steven seagal impression for those ive confused the answer is a resounding no now let me clarify i dont love just any cop movie im not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the s and now slowly gulp returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker im partial to those gritty earthy cop dramas like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection problem is these films come along just about as often as george w bush makes a cogent point so whenever a true cop movie does hit multiplexes i come running towards it like an eager puppy and inevitably i leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out for a movie called one tough cop which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spinoff no truth is im a sucker for those barren streets that gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops like modern day knights must shield us from their iniquitous clutches yes its all very corny and awfully boys clubish which im guessing is precisely where these feelings come from as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joes enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies etc the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies and heighten them turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos as an adult my tastes havent changed all that drastically sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film but i still delight at the promise a guy film could potentially bring now what if its the cops whore the corrupt ones ooh that one really gets me going these protectors using all that at their service taking advantage of others for their own gain throw a courtroom drama yech into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city how absorbing is prince of the city you ask so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama a subgenre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar i remained completely and utterly involved the film stars treat williams who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city i cannot provide an answer as to why it didnt though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves like mickey rourke and eric roberts both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory williams is a talented leading man who didnt make it to where he should have if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell here the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacinos in serpico also directed by lumet williams plays danny ciello a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty prejuliani streets of new york they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done the squad relies entirely on informants low level junkies to gain access to the big wigs and in order to obtain the info they seek they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice danny has done this and though hes a fairly honorable guy who took the job in order to do good his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a double agent he does so with one condition he will not rat on his partners right away we know that that is exactly what hell have to do and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be undercover cop films are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliches like in too deep how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal ambiguity and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet as well as a handful of intense performances most notably by treat lumets greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back and lets the camera soak up the action his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension and he rarely holds for reaction shots instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking lumets worst tendency is one that many film makers especially oliver stone tend to overuse he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension this isnt as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan lumets most recent cop lawyer endeavor a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria here he was on sustaining tension in a film that runs for minutes with not one dull spot some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable of course cop movies arent popular anymore yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines but just look at the average hollywood action movies flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isnt gay the lame comic relief character whos never funny and on and on for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills it focuses completely on its story and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies theres a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if hes about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human excuse me weak in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness straining to get the words out hes lost his voice does that little itty bitty detail matter maybe not to most but it sure made my night and in a sprawling

'city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most thoughtprovoking moving and completely unsentimental i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality city of angels is a wonderful film enhanced by interesting and wellrounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years its a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story and avoids most of the cliches were so used to seeing in films like this city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders film wings of desire i have yet to see wings of desire so i am unfortunately unable to make a comparison of the two i have heard however that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways which makes me glad that this film isnt a ripoff of its source material nicolas cage stars as seth an angel who like all of his angel counterparts is present to lead the dying to heaven or somewhere just like it one day he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr maggie rice meg ryan and his attention is called to her the angels can make themselves seen to humans but they cant experience any of the senses most importantly touch he shows himself to maggie and she falls for him unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status seth wants to become human so he can feel her thats when he meets nathaniel messinger dennis franz former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race as a side note i found messinger to be the most fascinating character for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel i know it sounds ridiculous but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally welldone after much deliberation she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel this of course is when seth decides to take the plunge literally from a building when he wakes up from the fall he is human and happy to feel what its like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead since i love this film so much ill make a minor note that it certainly isnt perfect although it is original and mesmerizing it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic though the details are what make the story excellent and steel has done a great job with them the ending too could have been more powerful and less predictable these elements are minor though and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels the acting is superb from everyone involved this is perhaps my secondfavorite performance from cage my favorite being the rock hes quiet and pensive and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softlytoned words hes perfect for a role like this and at the same time he reassures us hes not bound by playing the psycho though he is good at it as he shows in faceoff meg ryan is a powerful enticing and appealinglychirpy actress and her work here is some of her best dennis franz however steals all of his scenes as the energetic formerangel what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation director brad silberling is a talented man and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters rather than forced sentimentality his direction is steady and he shows this in just about every scene near the beginning maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead there is no music or elaborate camera work we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information this is the way stories should be told and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do cinematographer john seale the english patient provides some of the most stunning images ive seen on the big screen hundreds of blackclad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours just as an example the music by gabriel yared also of the english patient is perfect for this film its quiet and moody music but not sentimental and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of so far all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre its a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story acrossthe excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously ',?
'america has finally gotten what its needed for years a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma regretfully its only a movie president james marshall harrison ford is fed up with terrorist activities teaming up with the russian government he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek a reactionary general ready to reunite the soviet union under his fascist reign during a celebration dinner marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists its your turn to be afraid he declares returning home on air force one he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally ultranationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov gary oldman hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule which clinton says doesnt exist in real life but refuses preferring to stay and fight director wolfgang peterson das boot in the line of fire outbreak takes the overused die hard theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with holdyourbreath intensity if you can take your eyes off the screen steal a look at the audience everyone is totally engrossed the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder he does it so well when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead you know that hes over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time when korshonov executes passengers there is a frightening reality to it the guns in this film are deadly weapons not cartoons harrison ford has done one role for several years his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job realistically hes a man afraid but not afraid to act ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero indiana jones in the oval office he and oldmans archetypes match up perfectly the other roles also go to accomplished actors glenn close as the determined but unsure vicepresident is the picture of an executive forced into a position that shes not quite ready for dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority im in charge here is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance of course the politics are all wrong a cowboy president even down to his name with big guns shoots his way through problems much like the american collective memory of jfks camelot the image is wondrous if you dont look too deep the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film but they work here no matter what political spin you put on the story the movie is an outstanding one i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the countrys future not a common belief nowadays now if we only can get ford to run for president just because one actor didnt work out as chief executive doesnt mean that a different one couldnt michael redman has lost count of how many years hes been writing this column years years while watching the sunflowers outside his window swaying in the cool breezes ',?
'ladies and gentlemen s independence day is here its title starship troopers and surprisingly it is more entertaining than id i realize that i gave last years scifi hit a star rating but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour after subsequent viewings i feel that independence day really wasnt as great as it seemedthough i still give it a positive review starship troopers on the other hand has a mocking sense of humor knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem as a result starship troopers is a more exciting energetic and lively science fiction film in fact i probably could never get tired of watching this film starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars another kickass space opera which reinvented the scifi drama altogether while starship troopers is no star wars it comes quite close and the easiest assessment would be to call this film the star wars of the s am i being to generous to this film perhaps but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance effectively into the warring races in essence this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films and i may have to starship troopers is not quite an original film persay but director paul verhoeven gives the film a kickthealiensasses style id had this same style except it was forced most likely the cause of will smith having a major role this new star wars has a very simple basic plot mankind vs an alien species the alien species in question here is the bugs a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnidtype insects however the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes but during quiet moments we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization more than likely these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends and they should be i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thoughtprovoking film this is an event film but surprisingly above average it is extremely refreshing to watch a scifi war film and actually root for the human side something independence day never achieved starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange join the army ads mixing a webbased interface these summations of events are refreshingly original stating would you like to know more these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor and we know we should not take it seriously however we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle in a gory yet funny way after witnessing the slaughter the film jumps back one year to setup what we just saw we are introduced to johnny rico casper van dien and carmen ibanez denise richards rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school however carmen isnt as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot however another dizzy flores dina meyer has her eye on rico unfortunately rico isnt interested in dizzy this setup is rather cliched as is the result of the setup but it still is fun to watch carmen signs up to become a starship trooper and as a result rico signs up and as a result dizzy signs up everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy carmen gets the pilot position she wanted carl jenkins neil patrick harris a psychic gets a position in the training program and rico is left in the lowest of the starship troopers the mobile infantry the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships in reality i found myself watching a space version of melrose place but with better special effects an hour into the film the war begins a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with the first hour may have been a funny sometimes unintentionally setup but we grew to care for the flat characters because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters their gorgeous looks won me over call me superficial if you must following the training sessions which had many dramas in themselves too many to mention here the troopers are sent to war the bugs live on the planet klendathu a planet which consists of dirt and rock and pretty much nothing else many dramas occur during the war until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs attacks a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense the troopers are ordered to locate the brain and capture it i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible because starship troopers is not about plot its about special effects and gory violence director verhoeven most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct returns to his scifi days which gave us good films like total recall verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa but despite all the violence the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood starship troopers is extremely violent with more gore than this years event horizon the r rating is well deserved and hopefully parents will not allow their year old children to see it my guess is that verhoevens target audience is the to male group the film has a testosterone level off the charts with chiseled men and beautiful women despite these superficial elements starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful while watching the film we never second guess the characters decisions because they seem perfectly clear thankfully no hero is punching aliens in the face which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with but they soon grow on you casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon to most guys he will come across as artificial fortunately van dien is the worst of the cast despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character her dizzy is extremely likeable denise richards also does a good job and her scenes are very well done jake busey gary buseys son gives a wonderfully funny performance and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film neil patrick harris remember he was doogie howser is a little wooden and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast however he does give a good performance michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm his performance rises above the rest perhaps it is because his character is the most developed but i think it is just ironsides presence on screen unfortunately no particular cast member gives a starmaking performance which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars director verhoeven is the main star of the film his direction is fast and unrelentless he never slows down his pace which makes for a wild ride writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein the writing is usually very funny and sometimes very corny the dialogue is smart but not too smart we arent required to know everything but some plot holes are left unanswered thankfully we are not intended to notice and we really dont except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while amazingly with all the wars and romance going on the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues in fact these governmental changes seem fairly plausible and this adds another layer to the story the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage i havent laughed this loud even in some comedies oh and the special effects are first rate starship troopers is rated r for graphic scifi violence and gore and for some language and nudity believe me when i say this dont take young kids to see this film it is extremely violent in fact it is probably the most violent film out this year however if you are old enough over to see it starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain its been a long time since i have cheered for the heros while also cheering for the bad guys and still it is my dream to see a scifi film in which the alien race destroys mankind and take over the world now that would be entertaining ',?
'im not quite sure what to say about mars attacks which is obviously the work of a deranged genius when tim burtons twisted alien invasion comedy really works its breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure and when it doesnt work its just dull im not even sure it works more often than it doesnt but where it counts that is when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come mars attacks is brilliant mars attacks is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the s and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summers independence day old alien invasion flicks disaster movies and bigbudget special effects extravaganzas but unlike independence day which was a painfully middleoftheroad appeal to the hearts minds and wallets of america mars attacks has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings mars attacks portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are the title sequence is just splendid an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfmans thundering theremindriven score is absolutely jawdropping its so overwhelming that i swear to you i had trouble breathing the movie lays low for the next minutes we get a glimpse of the alien leader resplendent in a purplesequined cape when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world naturally the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming but mostly the first act is spent developing characters setting up mildly comic situations and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton its a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens because burtons just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars anyone who comes to mars attacks expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed with few exceptions these characters are dispatched as the film progresses jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr strangeloves buck turgidson glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white houses kennedy room a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a bighaired pointybreasted sexpot lisa marie the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood in an earlier scene its made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j fox is her newsman husband the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles they blew up congress and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace jim brown and tom jones are the films vegasbased heroes and director barbet schroeder reversal of fortune has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president also on hand and underutilized are annette bening pierce brosnan pam grier lukas haas and natalie portman the latter two also show up in woody allens everyone says i love you the real stars of course are the computergenerated martians and theyre fantastic with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skullfaces round eggeyes with red pupils darting this way and that these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate joe dantes gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory but burtons little monsters are more inventive the films raison detre are the scenes of crimes against mankind the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault easter island is turned into a bowling alley and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans the sheer level of mayhem is staggering especially when the aliens make their first attack blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg rating its earned the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day although mars attacks was in production long before that films release cinematographer peter suschitzky who makes the most of wynn thomass wildly imaginative production design thomas helped define the spike lee style actually took time off from his mars attacks regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg cronenbergs movie will almost certainly be more somber it wont be released in the u s until early next year but mars attacks is surely a similarly elegant nightmare this is not a nice movie and which studio executive was duped into giving burton million to make it by setting the films final scenes in the nearly empty holocaustravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided burtons invasion epic suggests that the world weve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead the victims of his invasion are naive greedy or disastrously selfabsorbed and a good thing too since the movies wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wishfulfillment fantasy the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers who triumph by determining that the alien invaders the ultimate elitists are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture ultimately this messy masterpiece is the years funniest comedy and a weird winking affirmation of the power of the people ',?
' the celebration is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant you know where you sit down to watch it and no matter what youve heard about it before you just cant help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like i dont really feel there are to be any real rules for cinema a film can do anything as long as it makes it work but i do ask that all films have one thing in common they create experiences when i watch a film no matter what kind of film it is i want to be able to take certain memories along with me the celebration is great because its chock full of those it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial just to make sure youre paying attention which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored then youre of your attention span needs a bit of a tuningup the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch henning mortizen who has just turned and is having a party thrown for him all his friends and family turn up and for the first half hour we get introduced to everyone simplistically and realistically no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here the eldest son christian ulrich thomsen looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell is the first to be seen in the film walking to his fathers home his brother michael thomas bo larsen drives by pulls over greets him then kicks his family out of the car forcing them to walk to the estate just so christian can be comfortable we then meet helene paprika steen their sister a woman who always seems to be stressedout who invites the driver of her car gbatokai dakinah an american to to come join her at the party shes going to once theyre all there and settled in the party begins and as custom the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad so christian stands up at the head of the table and reveals the films punchline his father raped all his children at a young age but since this is a familyfriends affair his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth and is simply brushed off despite his efforts and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir and its all terribly interesting to watch twists occur and soon the film has taken on a nearlyfarsical nature but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends the most notorious thing about this film which has been getting the most notice though is that the director thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion as a member of the danish filmmakers clan dogme a group that has vowed to oppose the auteur concept makeup illusions and dramaturgical predictability so that they may purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot i have not seen breaking the waves the other notable film by a member of this group lars von trier to be exact but the celebration works exquisitely in this department it feels like reality like youre actually watching real people and not actors and as a major pointer has been shot on video as a result it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film but always wanted to we see key moments in peoples lives that they wouldnt dare show to the world and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style as ironicallyshowmanship as it really is works perfectly for the nature of the film the key though to this film and the reason its not just a cool danish import is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth throughout the film we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies a debate so threedimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his thetruthatallcosts reasoning out of the water of course it was not right for the father to rape his children and of course they couldnt have fought back then and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them and yes its thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier but then again the father after all is not a totally bad guy and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier we also see a man who has also learned to live with what hes done and deep down feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface the final scene involving mortizen and everyone else is utterly devastating thanks to him and thomsen whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex everyone else is flawless as well the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays exactly like life as such the celebration may be the one truly bizarro film of the year a work of art so eerily close to reality that its utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating ',?
' psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget third rate ripoff but no this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria perhaps italian horror director dario argentos most consistently successful film what impresses most in rewatching this surrealistic supernatural thriller is that argentos directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a nearfully coherent narrative screenplays have always been his achilles heel confusing subplots gaping holes totally illogical incidents and reactions no question argento has always been a better director than a writer fortunately he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called suspiria de profundis the films storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance arriving at the school late at night in driving rain she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state what happens next and i dont make the comparison lightly is a murder sequence that for intensity shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcocks infamous shower scene in psycho its quite possibly a homage to hitchcock but with its baroque sets graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin this stunning sequence remains very much argentos own though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspirias opening minutes the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious souroldmatriarchfromhell roles she does so well several more violent murders ensue including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is well i wouldnt want to spoil things now would i and the films climax staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms has a gothic ghoulishness thats most impressive the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming and not just for the violence deep red and phenomena for example have been appallingly hacked about fortunately the cuts to suspiria about minutes in this version have not adversely affected the film the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done too excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region and the soundtrack it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else as it stands the use of goblins music in suspiria is outstanding apparently argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewers overall experience even better see suspiria in a cinema where youll get the added bonus of widescreen and the colours deep reds eerie blues a superb use of shadow and contrast the cinematography of luciano tovoli whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female is uniformly superb a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argentos more surreal excursions the other most notable example being inferno on which bassan also worked suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors and it is fully deserving of its cult status the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated thats always been one of argentos shortcomings but overall this is a fascinating compelling example of italian horror ',?
'i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one folks i loved the wedding singer but it gets worse if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence hell same paragraph as the wedding singer im bound to be lynched well lynch me then because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory with titanic as the only exception right away youre ready to discount my review arent you youre thinking that i cant possibly know what im talking about after all this is adam sandler right well theres more i actually got choked up and more than once yes the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes but before you shrug me off as an imbecile i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself the wedding singer is the story of robby hart sandler a rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so but when his own wedding results in a noshow for the bride angela featherstone as linda robby begins to reexamine his life and wonder why true love doesnt exist for people like him in the process of performing at these receptions robby meets a waitress named julia played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore whose reputation is anything but this character julia too is engaged and when robby finds himself without a wife his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding seeing as how her fiance the miami vice loving glenn matthew glave doesnt seem all that interested as the time goes by we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding hes merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women its obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for this isnt sleepless in seattle but id actually compare it to that before id compare it to happy gilmore while the wedding singer maintains some of that postsnl cornball humor its sincerity and charm carry it a very very long way sandler is great in his role and yes if you allow it you can take him seriously barrymore seems perfect along side him and although the two more likely represent genx moronism and partygirl ditzism respectively the two go together like bread and butter as a mideighties couple one scene in particular where julia ponders the future in a mirror is so well done i was on the verge of tears unfortunately sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a nobrainer but its got so much surprise substance packed inside that im encouraging everyone to go see it in fact the entire theater applauded when the film ended and laughs were so consistent some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar the setting was milked for everything it was worth and for those of us that are old enough to remember it it was a bodacious trip back and done very well sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm or is it anticharm while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars its hilarious and its touching its got that great cheezy humor but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected this is one to see again and again is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of my magic ball predicts it is certain ',?

'ive noticed something lately that ive never thought of before pseudo substance hollywood faking deep meanings in their films have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed then when you look back you realize there was something missing more and more filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff im not trying to say city of angels is that bad it had a lot going for it but somewhere along the way it faltered somehow underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography the predictable ending that shattered our hopes even though we saw it coming only added to the disappointment but for over an hour city of angels is well worth the time nicolas cage is seth a guardian angel who like hundreds likely thousands or even millions of other angels spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life meg ryan in her most subdued performance yet plays maggie a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is were fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive after losing a patient on the surgery table these questions envelope maggie and seth the angel who was there to oversee the patients transition into the afterlife is immediately captivated by the doctor he begins following and observing maggie falling more and more in love with her everyday angels who we quickly learn are not and never were humans can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire seths adoration is too much to resist and eventually he does appear to maggie quite regularly although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community the angels are interestingly presented all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities but its a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness cage is a wonderfully versatile actor think faceoff raising arizona and it could happen to you what a combo who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once its nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire the two arent very comparable to each other but they both deviate from her usual intelligently ditzy romantic comedy roles and its an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy but even though the two leads do an impressive job it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye its a shame that with so much going for it city of angels falters so much in its final stages leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there they just didnt know quite how to get to it they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on remember and convey to others thru word of mouth so after telling us for minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths based on the german film wings of desire that being the english title of course city of angels is ninety percent success enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings even the devastatingly disappointing ending most movie goers the noncynics anyway will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized nonetheless city of angels is beautifully captivating which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories ',?
'up until about a year ago john travoltas career consisted of those look whos talking movies notice how they never called them look whos talented and the bomb shout which was bad enough to make most people scream but somewhere along the line travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in would experience fame and fortune once again while barry robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a straighttothecutoutbin album aptly named size isnt everything and of course they learned that sales are everything but now travoltas back on the hollywood scene once again and i think we all know why four words contract with the devil and this has nothing to do with newt gingrichs contract with america no satan is much more humane anyway yes travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld how do i know i own the document in question amazing what you can buy at those collectors shops for a few hundred dollars isnt it get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction with travolta as crime minion chili palmer he goes to collect some of the mafias money from a bgrade director gene hackman and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game sure a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood but i guess thats beside the point palmer is determined to get hackmans next project made so he sets out to convince big star martin weir danny devito to star in the movie bringing along downandout horror actress karen flores rene russo who has already had affairs with hackman and devito it doesnt take a las vegas oddsmaker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well after the customary sexual tension and denial which has been used in every comedy from whos the boss to speechless it works in this case unlike whos the boss although its interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackmans other films and want in on this one too along with travoltas mob boss trying to track him down for defecting get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction despite the obvious similarities this movie doesnt have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies ive seen this year yes even better than halloween vi get shorty is my kind of movie one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence im definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on are you getting this shorty ',?
'this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueffs play hospitality suite its about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention whose chicago company has sent them to wichita where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the th floor of the hotel where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna someone named dick fuller who is the head of a big industrial corporation he is someone they have never met before but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account it is their only reason for coming to the convention the big kahuna revels in salesmentalk among the three white christian males two of them larry spacey and phil devito who are veteran salesmen having teamed together for the last twelve years while bob facinelli is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why what comes into question is their opinions on life and death on god and morality and on how they make a living these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch their dialogue is acerbic witty and analytical following in the long tradition of salesmen films from death of a salesman the tin men and glengarry glen ross as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high in this case it is landing the big kahuna they each are trying to see why hes on top and why they are chasing after him what makes this film different than the others is its blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion to what they do as both must sell their product and how after each ones psyche is stripped clean by the other there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in bob is a baptist who takes a very nonquestioning and literal attitude about religion to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin according to the way he reads the bible when asked by larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and cant even say because he loves her only that marriage is something sacred to him the contrast in their personalities is stark larry is all business he simply wants to close the sale he comes into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman he criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such a small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burnedout he tells him to go on a vacation get a woman while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change now that he is and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in he has always been a charmer shaking everyones hand trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale larry is more aggressive as a salesman he is always a heart attack away from every big sale in contrast bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him this is his first time for him on the road when dick fuller doesnt arrive at the party the salesmen throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering when told that he spoke to the secretary larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account but when they start talking to bob whom they forced to act as the bartender they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another mans name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob to attend larry and phil cant fathom how bob didnt make a sales pitch but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fullers attention about their companys product as they sent him off to meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives these three performers were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through with a marvelous performance the only problem with the film is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see ',?
' seven is one of the best mystery movies ive ever seen its extremely intriguing and suspenseful but its also quite fun its a serial killer mystery but you dont care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer the story is a copsonthetrailofserialkiller mystery someone is murdering people who are offenders of the seven deadly sins a fat man gluttony was forced to eat himself to death a lawyer greed is slaughtered by his own rich possessions i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the good guys which makes the unseen villain seem so vile brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills the cocky rookie however morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset the wise veteran on the verge of retirement and he doesnt get killed by the end there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief this is impressive because the mood is so tense and the fact that it can be downplayed as well as it is here let alone at all is quite an accomplishment the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil scary place many believe it to be the production design is superb in the spirit of batman and the crow this film embodies the gothic mood the way the words fade in and out along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level even the credits are scary the killers victims have no connections at all and thus mills and sommerset dont have much to go on to solve the case they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect lets just say it seems a little too mystery movie or too convenient in other words when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe a terrific chase scene ensues this is a typical thrilling element but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story if anything this film is the epitome of twist endings i dont have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal but the way in which this happens is surprising there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives and even though hes obviously insane his charisma makes for some good points whats even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the films resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is seven is not just a film about crime but about the evil within man john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of scum but as justified as he makes himself seem we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice ',?
'the first thing you notice about this movie is that its cold placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snowcovered ground against a background of white just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night as with most coen brothers films this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes each of which works out in the oddest way possible a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does in brief scenes of vicious violence people get shot through the head in the back face chest and various other areas of the anatomy there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen remarkably enough most of the movie is played for laughs even more remarkably it works the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff frances mcdormand who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity with every good film the audience gains new knowledge here you learn two things everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy and dont do violent illegal business with lowlife amoral degenerate scumsucking losers oh yeah if you get shot in the face using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy ',?
'hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death no pun intended honest its a shame too because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old bmovie monsters i mean come on are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour hell no and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well not commonly associated with horror films and not only has the idea been done too many times but with the possible exception of from dusk till dawn has not been done very well lately either this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu i got to go back to the times when making movies even horror movies was considered an art form and not just done to make cash like nowadays and that is exactly what this film is art ive been a horror fan since i was eight years old and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers let me backtrack a minute when i say intellectual ground i dont mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to a little bit of thinking is involved with most modern slasher movies like friday the th and whatnot you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen you see this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore this is a thinking mans slasher flick the nosferatu of the title is orlock max shreck a strange hermitlike count that as the film opens is looking for a new home to buy he employs the help of hutter gustav von wangenhein a real estate salesman or something to that effect who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen greta schroeder upon orders from his boss hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlocks castle and speak to him about his new home which just happens to be right next door to hutters the next morning he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck not really a good sign he then discovers through some reading that the count is a nosferatu or vampire one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans but by the time he pieces this together he is too late orlock has already embarked to hutters hometown via boat will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock the character of orlock is of course dracula the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strockers novel just thought that was an interesting little side note probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainments digitally restored cut now available in stores however this version is quite different than maunaus original masterpiece the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type onegative and color tinting much like the version of langs metropolis now i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here bringing a like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one but alas i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen but thats just my bag you may like the newer more modern version better either way i suggest investing your money in a copy if you like what they have done with it pop it in the vcr and enjoy if youre like me just do what ill do during future viewings turn the color all the way down on your television hit mute turn on some bach or mozart or whatever dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made ',?
'we all know the fate of childs play which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially sequel hell with the newest installment in the quasipopular series currently out that would be bride of chucky and it grossed million in its opening weekend which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five its kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original a task which is a retread for some and for others namely myself a chance to see what all the fuss was about alas the original childs play actually isnt that bad even seeing it in the tiny claustrophobic and mechanicallychallenged theatre at my college wasnt the horribly dull experience i thought it would be not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd which you almost need to watch a film like this and if you dont believe me try and watch this flick by yourself one day but because as a whole this isnt a bad movie its not great but it does have two things that many horror films like this one dont have a rather nifty premise and a sense of humor both which save this from horror hell which is precisely where say i know what you did last summer has recently gone the premise of childs play is that a serial killer named charles lee ray brad douriff is shot and almost killed by a chicago hardboiled detective chris surrandon see what happens to some oscar nominees and before he dies utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kids doll called chucky a doll which has got to be the scariestlooking kids doll ive ever seen the next day a bum whos stolen it sells it to singlemother karen barclay catherine hicks who then gives it to her young son andy alex vincent for his birthday of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll but certain twists come up like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll that being andy and soon enough chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun and people are discovering that chucky isnt just a kiddie doll one by one the idea is a neat one ripe for lots of comic terror and luckily it utlizes a lot of that it plays with an idea stolen from a looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive they tell people about it but when he tries to prove themselves chucky does nothing and everyone thinks theyre crazy it plays with this as well as the whole childlike thought that dolls and toys come to life and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments even if theres an entire sequence devoted to cliches a woman alone in a house hears a noise goes to investigate it and finds nothing but wait for the kicker a second later theres also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience the ending is rather fun as well albeit a tad too drawnout about four different endings maybe five and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film lineup making them easier to sympathize with if theres one horrible thing about many horror films its that the protagonists are morons who you cant help but shout obscenities at and for the most part childs play steers away from that and most of all the chucky character is a good one not just because he provides instant comic relief look that dolls moving on its own but because hes a generally scary character if theres anything really wrong with childs play its that its too trite and has too less self esteem at almost minutes childs play features way too less to be a real of horror it throws itself into a simple three act setup that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it werent for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film which isnt necessarily a bad thing as such childs play is content to be just the short typical horror film but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasicampy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short typical horror film ',?

'lets say you live at the end of an airport runway large jetliners continuously pass over your house rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace lets say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home now lets say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway and offers you more than its worth wouldnt you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed of course you would but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise and the house your castle thats what they are to darryl kerrigan michael caton and although hes happy that a multinational corporation would like to buy his home sorry its not for sale unfortunately the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice not about to take this lying down darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto tiriel mora and makes a determined albeit pathetic attempt to fight back the castle an australian comedy by rob sitch is perhaps one of the simplest movies ive seen in recent memory yet also one of the funniest in fact it is this films reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful the good guys and the bad guys are clear the humor is straightforward and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets its the perfect setup for a relaxing hilarious good time and as much as i hate to admit it i liked the fact that i didnt have to think all that much while watching this film i just sat back and enjoyed myself the situation is one weve seen before regular joe fights back against the government or big business or whatever what makes this film different is its characters darryl thinks hes got the best life in the world he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when hes got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal anne tenny and he swells with pride when his son dale stephen curry digs a hole in the yard steve kerrigan anthony simcoe constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for investments like jousting sticks and overhead projectors while wayne kerrigan is in jail as a result of dennis denutos incompetent courtroom maneuvers the great thing about the kerrigans is that they arent so stupid that they get annoying theyre just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing we look upon them with a little bit of pity but a whole lot of affection screenwriters sitch santo cilauro tom gleisner and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans sympathy for their situation the laughter they bring us and the familys wonderful characterization simple as it may be leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans but trust me it works i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs dont get me wrong slapstick when executed well can be genius its just that too often a film will resort to its use as a shortcut to amusing the audience not always successfully instead the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world when they are by themselves the are funny and when they are with normal people they are hilarious one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the films running time luckily its a funny little detour that while slightly distracting from the films main drive is still quite enjoyable with all the levity abound in the castle the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes im not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution of australia and certainly sounds impressive at any rate and for that matter its more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this ',?
'the last steve martin film i saw the spanish prisoner was a very different approach for the comic actor as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob a process from a clueless businessman martins character did it all for money in his most recent movie bowfinger martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name that will make him more popular at the parties and most importantly that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door playing the title role martin is once again the good guy the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie this con man is very likeable for some reason even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner maybe the message is that in hollywood to win over the trust and friendship of others you have to be a little evil bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars martin who also wrote the screenplay is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best peter sellers in two different but equally hilarious roles one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy burger king employee brother the story follows aging and failing directorproducer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a baction movie called chubby rain in order to attract actors and crew members bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it but this wont stop the aggressive bowfinger he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage will bowfinger be able to make his film or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on bowfinger is a very cartoonlike movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about it is always funny to see actorsdirectorsproducers making fun of themselves or coworkers especially in a playful movie such as this besides the very repetitive and superflous ending bowfinger is a joy to watch if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures the movie is great fun ',?
'capsule bleak and pointblank just the way it should be makes its case with coldblooded precision and intelligence serial killer chic is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary and one of the more stomachturning ones ive never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry i wasnt sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic heroantihero thankfully thats not the way henry works the director john mcnaughton took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work it doesnt provide cheapjack explanations for henrys behavior it shows him up for what he is an unrepentant and unidolizable man who killed when the mood struck him at the films opening henrys friend ottis toole has a sister who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago in a viciously riveting scene he admits matteroffactly to having murdered his own mother and she covers his hand with hers they are damned together from that moment on henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it theres a scene where the two go to buy a new tv the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron no preface it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker in a scene which many damned the movie for unseen they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment the movie itself however does not glorify the killings but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work only irritation henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame just standing there and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton but he decided to give them something more memorable and consequently the film nearly didnt see release the film does not glorify or justify it just shows us with unflinching coldness what henry was im hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of victim or hero then again probably so would henry ',?
'along his carreer mel gibson has collected several successes not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view for all that i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace a popular scotch hero of the th century where he would also perform the principal role accepting so huge challenge mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years with a suppoosed failure just to see recognized by everyone all his potentialities and that way to consolidate his position in hollywood it was definitely an enormous risk but im sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face braveheart is in fact a magnificent and magisterial film for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narratives rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest the william wallaces story is the story of so many others brave libertys defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value along the centuries seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i king of england in a war by the autonomy of scotland as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone including the princess isabelle of wales wife of edwards son however william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty nowadays mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i the king longshank the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good sophie marceau as princess isabelle has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen as robert the bruce and of course mel gibson as william wallace however i think this time the mel gibsons work as director was much better than his work as actor the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes view by the camera of john toll then we realize all the beauty of this film braveheart is in my opinion one of the best movies of ive heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean for now lets see if braveheart equalizes the oscars of lawrence of arabia it wont be easy its gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson ',?
'meet joe black is your boymeetsgirl boylikesgirl boygetskilledinhorribleaccident supernaturalentitytakesoverboysbody supernaturalentityfallsinlovewithgirl story based on the film death takes a holiday meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love william parrish anthony hopkins is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his th birthday he has built a huge media empire and raised two beautiful daughters allison marcia gay harden and susan claire forlani william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality the one situation he wont be able to talk his way out of and he has good reason to fear for death himself is stalking him however death has a deal to make death has taken possession of a man who has recently died brad pitt and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living in return william gets to live a few extra days of course he agrees death under the human name of joe black gets to experience life as a complete innocent he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter and hes not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love but is their affair doomed to an early demise at nearly three hours in length meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side though it never gets boringly lengthy instead the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere rather than being hurriedly rushed through it the romantic angle works well though surprisingly the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter this is most likely due to anthony hopkins who once again displays his superb acting skills william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life and doesnt want to let it go by contrast claire forlani is merely the romantic interest she gets to show joe the ropes of love but is hardly as interesting a character as joe black brad pitt seems a bit stilted granted hes supposed to be outofplace but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role still he is able to hold his own and over the course of the three hours his character begins to grow on you the main character who seems out of place here is drew jake weber an ambitious executive in williams company who is joe blacks main rival for susans affections weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily but never distractingly so we never learn what is the exact nature of death or why hes never done something like this before it actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voicesaccents his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter and the ultimate resolution to one of the films supernatural problems seems well somewhat superficial still even with the films length it was a pleasant time at the movies something you wouldnt necessarily expect from a film about death but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow ',?
'if theres one thing in common about all of hollywoods major studios its that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures fox searchlight and fine line respectively its obvious theres no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater so when a movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production its a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for a nothought movie quite the opposite is true in fact as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen the story both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation captures the essence of statementmaking in the cinema not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who through quite a bit of luck find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named pleasantville maguire as the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudoworld but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the fatherknowsbest times its not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end and begins to teach the townspeople in a quite unlikely way what life is really like soon hues of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness at one end is a soda shop ownerturnedpainter named mr johnson jeff daniels and at the other end is a closeminded mayor j t walsh and his chamber of commerce but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town fine performances are turned in all around maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j t walsh in his latest and final posthumous performance daniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackmans envy for daniels its his most commendable performance of the last three years or more and for walsh its a complementary exclamation point on a fine career also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish theres not much to dislike about pleasantville and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who dont ',?
'i can hear the question already what on earth do these two movies have in common to most people not a lot except that both are by renowned directors as i saw them however both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers but oh how differently the packages affect their films while everyones production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special jane campions imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones script is i left everyone says i love you not remembering a lot about who loved whom but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face i left the portrait of a lady not remembering a lot about who loved whom and i could have cared less everyone features nothing allen hasnt done before storywise woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman roberts and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrongagain similar situations happen to his family and friends some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his early funny films the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of take the money and run his directorial debut however nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this oneofakind display of sheer good spirits in fact in this movie the feeling itself is whats most important yes the movie would have been betteramong his very best i thinkif it had a meatier story but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling and what better way to express feeling than through music love is often best expressed in a song and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart some are a tad too goofy such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor but i admired allen for even putting them in there it also helps that as usual allen has a topflight cast working with him their singing voices range from quite good goldie hawn to not quite good allen to literally unlistenable barrymore whose real voice was dubbed by a professional but while their vocal abilities differ all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen and making it rub off on the audience granted some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies but for those attuned to it this film should work wonders jane campion too has a topflight cast working for her in portrait of a lady too but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted virtually lifeless mess albeit a visually interesting one campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eyefilling images that linger in the mind unfortunately what didnt linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people even worse i dont find myself feeling bad that ive forgotten the problem i think lies not with the cast which seemed to be trying very hard for the material it was the script that couldnt convince me to care about anyone the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion but i found no reason to connect with any of them i understood that the story was about cold emotionally vacant characters but for me to care about them i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives jones script never simply gave me that opportunity in the end it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes unfortunately as she kept painting these dazzling pictures they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film in the end the movies one strength ended up hurting it so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them why with both films my head cared about neither story but only everyone says i love you was able to make my heart sing ',?

remote control boat race but snowbell wants stuart out of the house hes unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying its ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery cgi the character of stuart while obviously a computer generated image grows on you as the film progresses and youll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film as many of the supporting cast are actual cats with computer animated mouths so they can speak its fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with stuart little is a charming family film there are some great laughs in the movie with a script cowritten by the sixth senses m night shyamalan no less some moments that can only be described as too cute the boat race sequence is what won me over and even the majority of the oneliners common nowadays in childrens films or films featuring nathan lane are tolerable kids and parents will love this one stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video there are two different dvds on sale one contains the film in full frame and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital audio both versions also contain the following extras and hang in there with me here theres a lot of them a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors an isolated score track an interactive trivia game an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo and a stuart little readalong story which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you there are also three music videos and six theatrical trailers called thecatrical trailers get it its funny for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases the adventures of elmo in grouchland madeline the nuttiest nutcracker muppets from space and baby geniuses the only bad thing about this entire dvd i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses dvdrom features are also on the disc including web links and a demo of the stuart little cdrom game but wait theres still more theres a section called basement treasures where you will find the auditions of the films animators six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director a visual effects gag reel a production gag reel and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene with commentary from the director the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the films production minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski who wrote the people vs larry flynt and ed wood and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel who wrote splash and multiplicity among others anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track serious animation buffs will love the second one now i know this is slightly off topic but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called i need to know by a group called r angels this video features four midteenage girls the singers obviously having a slumber party the girls ask a ouija board i need to know who to do who to do who to do as the song begins they then sneak out of their house and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle streetwalker outfits then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like ill be your pleasure all the time just say the words that youll be mine um what the hell what does this have to do with stuart little how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd when the video concludes the words to be continued appear oh i cant wait to see who theyve slept with when the toy story dvd comes out kids wont care about most of the special features on this dvd but those of

'driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small intimate story its a quiet film a slow film a deliberate film but if youre patient with it the movie offers innumerable rewards such as a pair of selfassured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhrys pulitzerprize winning play of the same name which first opened in new york four years ago the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago los angeles london vienna norway and the soviet union uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy he also penned the wonderful sleeper mystic pizza the film like the play is set in atlanta georgia and it revolves around two people in their twilight years a cranky something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a something black man who becomes her chauffeur the movie relies on character rather than plot to propel the action in fact the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense it doesnt present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together rather driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life shopping listening to the radio visiting the cemetery eating fried chicken and so on the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlantas history including the bombing of the temple the citys oldest jewish congregation and a ceremony honoring the reverend dr martin luther king jr the story begins in with daisy tandy crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway the insurance company cancels her insurance and her son boolie decides to hire her a chauffeur freeman reprising his role from the play plays the chauffeur hoke the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature aging prejudice and a great many other things but more than anything its about a relationship one that spans years cars the advent of civil rights and one gravely important cent can of salmon daisy is strongwilled and set in her ways and from the outset she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur initially she treats hoke with contempt refusing to let him drive her anywhere once she does get in the car daisy is the ultimate backseat driver to make matters worse she is extremely selfconscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand eventually however daisy is worn down by hokes goodnatured charm and infectious cheer she softens and opens up to him tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well but unfortunately this feisty cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace weve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations from on golden pond to cocoon nevertheless tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own freeman as hoke on the other hand gives the more distinctive of the two performances there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color hoke is uneducated and illiterate but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element in full command of their natural charisma they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movies gentle humor at the same time tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama in his first dramatic role dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie tandys loving and patient son drama seems to agree with aykroyd taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ghostbusters ii the great outdoors my stepmother is an alien the only other significant characters in the film are daisys housekeeper idella marvelously played by esther rolle good times and boolies pretentious wife played by patti lupone under the direction of bruce beresford crimes of the heart tender mercies driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again but fortunately beresford never forgets hes shooting a movie and accordingly he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches such as gorgeous shots of flowers trees and tomatoes in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say beresford wisely exercises restraint in the films dramatic moments the movie tugs at your heart but it never goes for the jugular the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees ',?
'with many bigbudget science fiction films great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts cheesy plot twists and terrible acting the fifth element the abyss and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting writing or both at first glance the matrix larry andy wachowskis scifikungfushootemup spectacular looks like a prime candidate to join the list of highconcept bad movies especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue the matrix works its an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films most obviously the terminator films star wars and total recall but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout reeves plays neo a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with trinity carrieanne moss a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks a unseen omniscient cult figure known as morpheus lawrence fishburne and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems moreover he discovers that the grim bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah with grave doubts that he is actually the one prophesized to come and save the world reluctant or not what follows is a mix of hong kongstyle slowmotion shootouts surreal dream sequences high speed chases and comic book kungfu fights the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion unfortunately the matrix doesnt provide many answers to the questions it raises but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions shootouts and flying roundhouse kicks perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving who plays agent smith the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix weavings stony appearance deadpan voice and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting evil technological force that controls the matrix like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t terminator in terminator judgement day weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because despite his power and seeming invincibility he looks ordinary even scrawny weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography it seems to be deliberately kitchy with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors in a few scenes the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring however with the comicbook style and tone of the film you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience the matrix isnt a its openended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero the kind of shmaltzy feelgood goo that most of the film avoids reportedly the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel unfortunately audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future the matrix is an fun enjoyable diversion like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival just dont be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry ',?
'at first glance three kings looks to be just another war movie the s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember the s version it definitely is just another war movie not in your dreams imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan thats three kings for you believe it or not it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war with the allied troops victorious majpr archie gates clooney leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox postwar looting spree the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home this wild bunch goes awol on an armed humvee the vehicle of choice of the us army they soon find out that they have much resistance as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men they become consciously attacked by their own morals as the film begins to roll it seemed to have a rather light mood to it special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a lighthearted funny action movie three kings is much smarter than that as the conflict becomes more and more complex the audience will be trapped in a limbo trying to stay focussed on that lightmoodseriousmood that the film seem to portray i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant action sequences are not shot as your oldfashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs inyourface war violence they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight closeups and pauses right before the action starts not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style tons of them starring clint eastwood great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film the screenwriter and the director three kings ranks among the best films of the year well for me at least highly recommended ',?
'as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on dday the weary seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck as the flap falls the battle begins they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire amid the chaos of this massacre stands a shot that at least for me hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindlers list a soldier clearly missing an arm wanders around the bodystrewn beach like a lost puppy we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself he bends over picks up his arm and starts to carry it probably not bothering to ask himself what now saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film the direction is out of this world surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar the cinematography by janusz kaminsky is also astounding but be forewarned this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get the question is does the story and its realism justify the excessive use the answer from my point of view is no braveheart was a truly gritty and one would imagine realistic battle film ryan is ten times worse expect disembowelments sucked in skulls heads blown to bits arms and legs flying across the battlefield many in the theater could not bear to watch and it is a shame too because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters and academy members saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on dday through into the films primary mission captain miller hanks assembles an man crew and sets off to find a missing solider private ryan whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs ryan doesnt recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons that no person should suffer such injustice millers crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan though they dont yet know him they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesnt have any more or less right to live than any of them this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and though there is a lot of set up between battles the story continues full speed to the end the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of its own spielberg though not a student of the quick cut school of filmmaking takes a stab at it here and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it bay should pay close attention take copious notes if you want to jump cut every two seconds do it the way spielberg does it in ryan in the end the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the importance of the film schindlers list taught many people the truth about the holocaust it opened eyes sparked debate and study though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before they dont amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindlers list overall this is just the truest depiction of the old adage war is hell but braveheartdosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again masterful work marred only by excessive gore ',?
'no humans were harmed tested or tasted in the making of this film all recipes are fictions twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul directorwriter antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive this true story briefly mentioned in the shining has no turned into a minutes long motion picture in the united states was a land of pioneers of goldstarved americans making their way west it was a period of manifest destiny the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could capt john boyd guy pearce has become both a hero and a victim during this period of relentless consumption in ways he could never have imagined boyds journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexicanamerican war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california upon his arrival he is greeted by a small motley group of soldiers including his commanding officer hart jeffrey jones a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life toffler jeremy davies the forts personal emissary to the lord knox stephen spinella the veterinarian that plays doctor who never met a bottle of whiskey he didnt like reich neal mcdonough the nononsense soldier of the group and the seriously overmedicated cleaves david arquette a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions into this cold bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger colqhoun robert carlyle a halfstarved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound seeking refuge in a cave they soon ran out of food and were forced to consume one another colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors doeuvre himself our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors and colqhoun tags along to help out soon it becomes clear that colqhouns tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive it involves an old indian myth called weendigo which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that persons strength spirit and very essence his hunger becomes an insatiable craving the more he eats the more he wants and the stronger he becomes there can never be enough and death is the only escape its all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through as professionally made as the movie is you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this teenage horror fans wont care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit but theyll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces but jokes aside this is a film that is well worth watching it has wonderful and mature characters that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end the two main characters are also the most interesting boyd is a simple honest man tiered of war killing and fear his sacred wish is to live a normal quite life away from gunpowder and blood colqhoun is different he proves that a man on the brink of death would do anything to stay alive including sacrificing his own soul he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen the atmosphere in ravenous is macabre and bizarre scary and surreal completely isolated from the rest of the world stands fort spencer here time stands still and nothing changes the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life men that are nothing and has nothing to loose the result is some sort of cabin fever cannibalism is more like a sick game for them since they find no pleasure in living they find some excitement in killing and dying its like whos going to die first the unchangeable icy landscape where birds do not sing and even wind doesnt move the leaves on the trees resembles kubricks the shining its hard to not get mad here one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters and starts to understand them although they have turned into half crazed killers music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere a strange musical score composed by michael nyman the piano and damon albarn that often seems out of place and in complete contrast to the image somehow reflects the characters twisted reactions on the world and their situation the director herself stated that it was ok to laugh during the picture and i must admit that it is often very funny in a strange way such as the wonderful quote its lonely being a cannibal you dont get that many friends or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin saying eat to live dont live to eat but mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change every actor does a great job especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier nagged by his undeserved honor this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordans interview with the vampire actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies since the topics are so alike ravenous starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring however these little failures dont diminish the impression this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations it is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyones soul a dark side which were all trying to hide but its there always it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since the shining i said no food i didnt say there was nothing to eat colqhoun ravenous ',?
'disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched to see a disaster film with actual originality or at least a decent plot twist would definitely be a welcome surprise unfortunately folks its not likely dantes peak is cliched and at times corny but also pretty decent to be honest i wasnt very interested in seeing this film and word of mouth as well as several reviews didnt make it sound promising so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasnt bad at all its pretty run of the mill but its not something i would say is merely ok to watch in case you dont know dantes peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in its shadow dantes peak who wouldve guessed eh pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future due to the lack of more substantial evidence nobody warns the small town and when they finally do its in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows brosnan all around good guy will of course save the day or at least the mayor of dantes peak linda hamilton naturally the two will become infatuated with one another if you think i just ruined a plot development you havent seen very many movies theres also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings and of course the kids or the dog at least one or the other will do something heroic but hey i dont want to ruin all the surprises if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dantes peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself its not brain food but it succeeds at what its meant to be an enjoyable suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash ',?
'perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects there is no question that actionadventure and sciencefictionaction movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise whereas adventure pics of the last twenty years such as raiders of the lost ark were made in grand traditional fashion contemporary films like jurassic park are multimilliondollar creations of computer technology the latest in this visually awesome series of movies the wachowski brothers the matrix is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movies story unlike many scifi movies which promote themselves as effectsheavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event it runs minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the films length contrary to popular trend the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound in this regard the movie is something like a card sharp with its flashy mass stripped away the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented the script is characteristically weak and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach but like the card sharp the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent the viewers dont care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner and right around the corner they usually are for the script tells a fastpaced albeit frequently revisited story as the movie explains the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence the matrix farms our life energy only a select group of individuals knows of the real world and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultracool morpheus laurence fishburne morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo keanu reeves believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion the set design is very dynamic running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy the costumes as well as the actors who wear them add to the roles for instance the manifested antagonists in the movie a group of agents created by the matrix in its computer program all dress in matching secret servicewear the rebel fighters on the other hand dress in rich hues of leather the casting cannot be criticized for the typically stoic reeves isnt required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool supports in carrieanne moss joe pantoliano and hugo weaving are all effectual one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last years science fiction masterpiece dark city particularly if one ponders how this same premise wouldve worked from a different approach the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear here the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrillride motion picture with little abandon and much noise the better picture between the two depends on the viewer but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun ',?

'contact is a film that tries to do several different things it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr ellie arroway jodie foster and the religious spokesman palmer joss matthew mcconaughey the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable albeit less immediately engaging than say the coldblooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tvs the xfiles the aliens in contact seem to be like usthey are more curious than anything else they know we exist they want us to know that they exist and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly and between the characters ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubricks a space odyssey most of the film however takes place on earth where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens scientists are enthusiastic ultraconservative religious leaders are wary and government officials are caught somewhere in between the debate is fueled largely by dr arroways atheism she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankinds representative to another species the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches science and faith could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed still the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society the two sides are represented primarily by arroway and by farright fundamentalists but in reality probably of americans are neither atheists nor farright fundamentalists palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a lessthanideal spokesman for any ideology then again the film does concentrate mostly on public debate which does after all tend to be dominated by extremists rather than on dinnertable or collegedormitory discussions contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues then but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself the films one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss for one thing it resorts to the tired movie clich that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction the romance rarely if ever sheds any light on the characters although it occasionally tries and fails josss explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement i guess you could say im a man of the cloth but without the cloth for example is more like a punchline to a joke than character development instead the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments granted this is a plot and ideadriven film and the characters are secondary but this just seemed like laziness on the writers part more than anything else the successes of contact however far outweigh its failures even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether which it didnt the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film contact doesnt quite cover all the bases but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a twohour film and its rejection of bigbudget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable and i would not be surprised if ten years from now contact is mentioned in the same breath as and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction ',?

'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels stories comic books or movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled as science fiction to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple technothriller in such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked but i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff film directed by philip kaufman the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits but the right stuff film isnt even fiction it was based on the nonfiction book by tom wolfe covering the early years of american space program the plot of the film begins in when few people heard of edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach mach speed and thus break the sound barrier many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado but one quiet pilot chuck eager played by sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records ten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age in order to regain national prestige us government decides to be the first to send man into space best air force navy and marine pilots are recruited into program but not yeager because he lacks college education and desired allamerican image in one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top films made in s such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufmans film looks quite atypical for its time with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for s and s age when hollywood used to make films larger than life but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation in s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original memorable movies the right stuff was the last of them swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual risktaking artsy projects the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film the plot is almost nonexistent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots embodied in yeager to new generation of the astronauts the film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the film but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents until that specialised only for bit or character roles sam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history books probably due to his own modesty on the surface he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases shepards performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as cleancut marine and future politician john glenn young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played by fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard kaufman left room for female talents to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vicepresident lyndon b johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufmans superb direction most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert as virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline everything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world in that setting its quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights but the times are changing ww alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war and natural pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined conventional pilots their entire lives become focus of media frenzy and their job is subjected to strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicityseeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played by scott beach only to preserve their most basic human dignity this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufmans superb use of poetic movie language editing is great and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military which provided authentic locations and period equipment he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space another fine contribution of this film is oscar awarded musical score by bill conti i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period this film is great and its cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaws some of the mercury astronauts arent fleshed out enough although being played by fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure on the other hand most logical conclusion of the film landing on the moon would require this film to be more than six hours long also some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians who were portrayed as evil monsters just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagans america in some of contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible and in order to do that he portrayed russians not as they were in real life but as they were perceived by americans in early s time has passed now we dont see astronauts as heroes in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up but this film sentimental reminder of the times when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky and even if they decide to stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema ',?

'when you go to the movies as much as i do you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times such was the case with frequency every time i went to a screening there was the frequency preview it looked awful it looked cheesy sappy and ridiculous it looked like a flop well whoever put that trailer together should be fired because in terms of pure entertainment frequency is one of the best of the year thus far frequency boasts a compelling story line an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan james caviezel to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan dennis quaid through a ham radio despite the fact that frank has been dead for years john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire but by doing so causes other changes somehow a serial killers reign of terror which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders extends to ten victims including johns mother this is director gregory hoblits third film the other two being primal fear and fallen with all three hes managed to attach himself to great scripts this one by toby emmerich whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films and add equally great direction also he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kickass ending frequency is no exception the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying hoblit is three for three and i hope he can keep it up now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the scifi elements of frequency but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved whos to say how something works and how it doesnt when its never happened is it because weve become accustomed to time travel laws from other places like star trek and the back to the future trilogy and quantum leap yes if you sit down and think about it certain plot elements in this film probably wont make any sense most films are like that dont let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however when frequency was over it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug okay okay shut up when you break it down past all its scifi elements and serial killer antics frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share its touching its sincere and its what ultimately makes this movie work pg ',?

'note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned on december amidst all the yearend oscar bait releases from the major studios miramaxs genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream although the teen horror market had been given up for allbutdead in recent years the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns eventually topping million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry suddenly everybody was looking for hip inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost scream director wes craven previously best known as the creator of new lines a nightmare on elm street film series was thrust back into the limelight and screams rookie scribe kevin williamson burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion its hard to understate this last point mr williamson has based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing scream i know what you did last summer from october and now scream enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame quickly become the most wellknown screenwriter amongst the entertainment weeklyreading box office figurewatching youth culture since well since that quentin tarantino guy whom it is said has also achieved some renown as a director indeed in a singularly freakish oddity it is the screenwriter mr williamson and not the director that has been receiving the lions share of acclaim for the success of scream and the print advertisements for scream s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence while the traditional a film by wes craven drapes the films title in the ads right below it in equal sized font yet reads written by kevin williamson an affirmation of the screenwriters contribution to the project which may be unprecedented i can envision the board of wga licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of a film by is attained and much like mr tarantinos screenwriting mr williamsons work is vaguely unconventional incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters in scream they satirically discussed other horror films here in the sequel the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels scream was written in during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood and mr williamsons rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel while the sequel was planned from the outset a treatment of scream was included when mr williamson sold the screenplay for scream the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived and its only at about the films midway point when it becomes engaging like its predecessor scream opens with a splashy eyegrabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the films principal narrative this time around were following the exploits of a young couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab a running filmwithinafilm gag where the true life events behind the first film has been turned into a movie however although it tries hard and has some good ideas the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overlynoisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore where her performance not only convinced me that she could act but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that ive ever seen there are too many knowing hip popculture references crammed into the scream sequence and the setup isnt nearly as cleverly frightening as screams while the first films preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying the payoff here is almost campily theatrical flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college where returning characters sidney neve campbell and randy jamie kennedy have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors singleminded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers courteney cox roars into town to cover the breaking story while everawkward former deputy dewey riley david arquette flies in to protectively guard over sidney theyre joined by cotton weary liev schreiber who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film his role here is significantly expanded the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isnt necessary not because so many people have seen the first installment but because this is after all a sequel to a slasher film what do you think happened to these characters in the prior movie theres a lot of new faces on the scene too sidneys new boyfriend derek jerry oconnell and her new roommate hallie elise neal randys fellow film student mickey timothy olyphant gales newlyassigned nervous cameraman joel duane martin omnipresent local journalist debbie salt laurie metcalf coed cici cooper ms buffy herself sarah michelle gellar and a pair of simpering sorority sisters rebecca gayheart and sirens portia di rossi any of these characters could be the killer or for that matter could be the next victim as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay the narrative is once again framed around the increasinglyflimsy premise of a whodunit one problem that scream didnt have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer here and to some extent in i know what you did last summer mr williamsons screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements it doesnt help matters any that the killers alterego is fairly obvious from the getgo indeed the finale plays as fullout camp when the villain is finally unmasked frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations scheming and motivation that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived the aspect where its headandshoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences theyre staged much more imaginatively here save for the first postprologue murder which is handled in such a mediocre conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable s slasher flicks that the first film satirized and are much more fun to watch its hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck and a catandmouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown in terms of its characters the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is wellwritten and theres a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed on the other hand sidney is pretty dull here she doesnt have any compelling presence and theres nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that shes the returning heroine given this and the fact that theres no strong second banana character for sidney elise neals role isnt nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowans shoes its no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film what surprises me the most about scream is its zealousness in decimating its cast the films mounting body count bears out the fact that no character is safe well almost while in principal i applaud this bold policy at some point youve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular whose casting for the next installment of the series wouldve seemed obvious but hey as rose mcgowans character said in the first film no please dont kill me mr ghostface i want to be in the sequel look what that got her ',?

'a fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july i didnt really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family the movie bombed at the box office and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based my real concern though was the general reputation of snlrelated movies translating to the big screen with lessthanstellar results halfbaked anyone i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining often hilarious yet also touching little film it is an al franken production throughandthrough who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture for those of you who dont know al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley who has a really annoying show on a publicaccess station about increasing your selfesteem etc although not a licensed therapist stuart smalley is as the program proudly boasts a graduate of several step programs stuart is doing well enough with his tv show but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles stuarts relatives are a mess his dad and brother harris yulin and vincent donofrio respectively are alcoholics his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce and his mom is in constant selfdenial and solves all perceived problems by baking then disaster strikes stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself and there the comedy truly picks up franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes but as sharplydrawn real people although smalleys dad has always imbibed too much stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy also after an accident towards the end of the movie both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought although filled with small very funny scenes stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments especially towards the conclusion for a lightweight comedy it handles these scenes especially well often better than many socalled serious dramas of today all the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a onejoke bit if you feel like renting a comedy and you havent seen this film i definitely recommend you try this one out youll laugh youll cry its all there ',?
'as i write the review for the new hanksryan romantic comedy youve got mail i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet i am also aware that i have just spent the last hours watching the worlds biggest paid commercial for america online and i wonder is that so bad well the commercial part is as for the movie well as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan i think ill be okay to paraphrase james berardinelli whose reviews i admire very much tom hanks and meg ryan can act they are both wonderful but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan and his glorious triumph in philadelphia i like him best when hes suitably obnoxious tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when hes going to get the girl the only question is how meg ryan americas high school sweetheart can act shes had a handful of memorable performances including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally i must not mention what she does due to the well um you get the idea and if you dont get the movie fantastic but i like her best when shes well perky she is so adorably perkycute that together with hanks they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime some people have them going back to really old romantic couples but i dont really know all i know is that i just like them both they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry thats really hard to resist and im not going to even try theyre just really really cute sweet and charming hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle here the setup is a little different kathleen kelly ryan owns a small childrens bookstore which her mother founded years ago and passed down to her she is successful beautiful and dates a wellknown columnist with very radical idea kinnear she is also having an affair of sorts you see kathleen with the handle shopgirl is secretly emailing ny they have a strictly undetailed relationship there are no specifics and they have no idea who each other is ny happens to be joe fox hanks a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of megabookstores run by his father coleman fox books has decided to open a store on the west side right across from a little childrens bookseller named shop around the corner run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly every morning these two email each other silly and every day they fight to the death its a charming premise and one that works nicely balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have it also has the great sense of being a romance there is no lets have sex tonight mantra if youll excuse my bluntness this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love hmm well the movie goes through twists and turns having some sad moments and happy ones until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan hook up to use modern terminology and kiss their way into happiness you know its going to happen the question is now thankfully ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey kinnear chappelle and a host of others including a great scene involving brothers aunts and two sweet kids its all cute and wonderful and for all of the idealism it makes me feel good hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is he is i believe americas greatest actor does he show it here nah but hes still tom hanks and shes still meg ryan which is what this movie boils down to its pure confection all the bits about the godfather the jokes the superb script its all really sweet there are some immense flaws like pacing the last third of the movie really doesnt work as well as i would have liked and for a romantic comedy its slow once hanks knows the secret it gets really slow i even looked at my watch a couple times to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for so that i could get home at a reasonable hour the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated email when my kids are my age i dont know what well be using but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history they just work together and its nice to see it gives you well a smile the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was ive always believed that movies are very powerful very powerful indeed you see mankind has three abilities he needs to survive the ability to think entertain and procreate movies can definitely do the first two and as for the third well id rather not think about that i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint and that films that entertained you were good because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had hanks was the driving force behind one of the years best films in saving private ryan which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world hes also half of the glue behind the years best example of pure entertainment tom hanks and meg ryan are magical as is this movie its a sweet lovely affair with a technology twist it may be a long commercial but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face ',?

'what surprises me most about the longawaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis i can hear batfans everywhere protesting first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker and indeed this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding oscarworthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown romero played the joker in the s tv series on one hand nicholsons joker is extremely funny his murderous escapades and manic outbursts which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film but on the other hand his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind the jokers cruelty and demented diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister this guy is off his rocker and he not only knows it he flaunts it but enough about nicholson as the joker im sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman like many i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting keaton delivers he is convincing as the tormented millionaire bruce wayne and beneath his hard black body armor he is mysterious and formidable as the batman even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city visually batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as the dark knight returns and the killing joke burtons film is a feast for the eyes the million budget is definitely on the screen the sets costumes and makeup are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations nicholson isnt joking when he boasts wait till they get a load of me his grimacing smile green hair and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous keatons wardrobe is equally appropriate batmans cape mask and body armor make him look threatening frightening and invincible bringing to mind not adam wests campy costume in the tv series but peter weirs outfit in robocop production designer anton fursts sets are a wonder gotham city is dark and foreboding almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york the batcave is cold bare and desolate the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption the movies gritty bladerunnerrobocop look is a joy to behold the plot on the other hand is not as rousing the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology but it fails to give us enough of either one as i mentioned earlier the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker but it never fully establishes batmans psychological motives and underpinnings in terms of action batman is not as thrilling as you might expect burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story more than anything batman is a mood film while batman may not completely absorb and excite you it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books thanks to its distinctive look the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world ',?
'the event of events is upon us people have waited twentytwo years for the prequel to star wars and diehard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it i dont think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history anyone who tells you its just a movie is either lying or clueless it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz which is far too weak a word that star wars epsode i the phantom menace so effortlessly generated but that does not mean that the film itself is bad in fact it is terrific i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash it is set some decades before the events of the original star wars took place the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging the trade federation angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small peaceful planet of naboo the republic sent two jedi knights people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as the force quigon jinn liam neeson and obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor to negotiate unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur the jedi and the queen of naboo natalie portman escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine where they meet the movies real focal point young anakin skywalker jake lloyd he is an innocent slave boy but the force is strong with him so qui gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi as any selfrespecting star wars fan should know anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actors movie around of the characters if not more are computer generated in one form or another and though the effects are seamless the movie lacks soul i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far with plenty of broad comic relief to go around much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jarjar binks hes essentially a computeranimated sidekick who says things like exqueeze me and mesa go now okeday and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying the visual effects are astounding although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them and the movie is a thrilling triumph if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement the climactic lightsaber battle oh come on as if you didnt already know among other things is outrageously entertaining and defines the term popcorn movie what made me surrender and give this movie stars was the score by john williams even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days his work here is nothing short of brilliant his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia when you see a long time ago in a galaxy far far away when the familiar music plays when the words star wars appear on screen youll feel a tingle even if you didnt see the movie when it first came out in it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin a boy whose innocence we know will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts we know that it will do more harm than good but they do not we not only feel more involved in the story but we feel like were seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years the phantom menace although lacking in human aspects of the story is a very worthy installment in the star wars it works as an action flick visually eyepopping and often paralyzingly exciting it also works as an elicitor of memories a piece of exquisite nostalgia eugene novikov ',?
'after having heard so many critics describe return to me as an oldfashioned hollywood romance i kept asking myself going into this movie what exactly is an oldfashioned hollywood romance what made return to me oldfashioned and oldhollywood was it the tunes from sinatra etc legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on was it the glamorous sophisticated feel the charisma of the two leads even now i cant say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer because i havent see that many oldfashioned hollywood romances i dont think any of the romances ive seen have been as such which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics return to me was oldfashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider it was traditional magical we knew it couldnt be too daring or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity tenderness and love from director bonnie hunt that it couldnt help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunts direction from the very first birds eye view of chicago zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland david duchovny accompanied by the return to me ballad by whom we can tell were in for something sweet the scenes between the characters are endearing truthful with just a hint of fantasy real people dont act that way real people arent that nice we know all this and yet we want to believe in these folks existence the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale but hunts rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal everything is ordinaryyet beautifulin this film from the festive little family restaurant to grace minnie driver and bobs wardrobes from the eloquent notinahurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen the most beautiful part return to me has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist we care for them laugh with them cry with them were concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father whatever hunt did she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors disappointingly david alan griers charlie however much i like him was the most flatlywritten duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona with the help of his fellow costars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of the xfiles duchovny who is excellent at understatement and selfdeprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer though an unlikely pair duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses while return to me functions remarkably as a laughoutloud comedy a romantic scenic tour through chicago and a tearjerker the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wifes heart we already know that theres going to be a happy ending we feel like we spend the entire film however enjoyably in a straight line going towards that point as a result bob and grace click almost too quicklyyes i know shes supposed to have his exwifes heart and everythingit seems too effortless the main subject is a love story and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters whose story might not have that much meat after all however in the spirit of return to me it wont do to be too picky about how old hollywood tells its stories i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt it shows the bottom line return to me is nothing remarkable and yet its sweetness sincerity and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadnt imagined ',?
'bill condons gods and monsters is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ian mckellan who made the horror frankenstein and bride of frankenstein since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but i suspect that much of it only came from whales inner fantasies and hallucinations whale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures decided fifteen years before his death at age to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him as the film tells it during the end of his life whale at his large home in l a became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who was working as the gardener at his home james whale we learn quickly was what many people refer to him as in the film a dirty old man in one of the opening scenes a young film enthusiast visits whales home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answers the young man must take off an article of clothing because of this episode we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off clayon agrees and doesnt really think much of this much to the warnings of his friends becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past certainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis gods and monsters is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to as a motion picture director rather than a horror director and in one heartbreaking scene he attends a party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore it is evident that whales first love in his life was making movies and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life as played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale comes off as a sad but dignified man and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others just as long as he knew he was being true to himself he never hid the fact that he was gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to while it means so much more to whale who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life although boone is only in a deadend job as a gardener of peoples homes whale views him as the ideal man not only one that is goodlooking even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings but one that will actually listen to him since whale lives with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor although an extremely fine and mature picture a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments but it is a little thin and the structuring of the onagainoffagain friendship at the films center is fairly predictable we know early on where these two characters are headed and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds in lesser hands this setup might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this also a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again if the film was not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether gods and monsters is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who i sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end walking away from gods and monsters it was ian mckellens marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably it is a sad testament when a persons true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life which ironically enough is no one elses business in the first place ',?
'as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell there is a wonderful eyecatching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film the shot has tibbs face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars to see these bars blocking his face we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots no matter how innocent tibbs is he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film in the heat of the night was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present preceding the very original a soldiers story and the recently released the hurricane in the heat of the night contains some lines and some very memorable characters the film which won best picture in focuses on vergil tibbs played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains tibbs is the perfect protagonist poitier also gives an excellent noteworthy voice to his character never nervous and always commanding his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing however unlike the hurricane where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger who won best actor for his excellent performance as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople he would refer to tibbs as boy and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him as the film progresses though there is a very gradual change in the sheriff he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors what i really enjoyed about steigers character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil instead it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day jewisons determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate in the heat of the night shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the s it displays this perfectly however the actual investigation although it is not the main focus of the film lacks interest it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane police officer sam being a suspect was not needed also it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson he managed to be in the two best movies of in the heat of the night and the even better in cold blood ',?
'the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider when those observers are joel and ethan coen the surreal becomes bizarre when the life is that of jeff the dude leboswki the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of whatsgoingonaroundhere the marvelous sound of the stranger sam elliot s voiceover introduces the film at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up the dude jeff bridges is described as the laziest man in los angeles possibly the world although hes not so much slothful as he is relaxed spending the last years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other he doesnt have much of a life but hes having a good time when asked what he does for fun he responds bowl drive around and the occasional acid flashback lebowskis passion is bowling when hes not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike things just happen to him arriving home one night hes beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them even worse they urinate on his rug the problem is that the dude doesnt have a wife his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment the big lebowski david huddleston is a multimillionaire and his dudeness lives in tworoom squalor the next day our ragtag hero visits his namesakes mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together not surprisingly since its virtually the only object there when hes denied any money he picks up a replacement rug off the floor on his way out he runs into lebowskis trophy babe wife bunny tara reid who offers to perform a sexual act that according to rumor is one of bill clintons favorites for a thousand bucks the penniless dude wisecracks that hes heading for the cash machine later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunnys kidnappers this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimesgonewrong sequences the kidnappers are impossibly inept the dude and his cronies are even worse every plan goes awry you can almost see lebowskis brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues thats the story but to tell the truth it doesnt much matter there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into the dudes bowling buddies walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi look like people youd see on the street but like everything else in this film theyre not quite what they seem walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but wont admit it walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet donny gets precious few words in between walters screaming and the dudes rambling when he does walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns donny is out of his league and doesnt have a frame of reference the film is peppered with people for whom the term character would be an understatement the big lebowskis daughter maude an avantgarde vaginal artist paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an sm mary martin the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler as the flamenco music swells we see him putting on his lavender hose the camera pans up to an allpurple skintight bowling outfit with jesus pronounced with a j not an h embroidered on the pocket he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has i cant think of anyone else who could have done a better job buscemi has a limited role but he plays it perfectly the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that hes one of the treasures of our time its odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barrs television husband more like the coens raising arizona than their hit fargo the big lebowski demands an open mind and even more open eyes a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss theres so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it walking out of the theater i felt that the film had something important to say on further examination i wasnt sure exactly what it was if you meet jesus at the bowling alley its not going to be what you expect when the going gets weird the weird go bowling maybe theres no real message perhaps its just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world maybe thats enough michael redman has written this column for years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about the man in the iron mask starring that favorite of yearold girls of all ages redmanbvoice com is the eaddress for estuff ',?
'while watching shallow grave i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens blood simple both are good films in which several characters none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes the body count rises and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands both films are also flawed but for different reasons blood simple is unrelentingly dark and moody but its characterizations were a little hollow shallow grave on the other hand is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes and then the filmmakers throw away much of what theyd accomplished for a more standard audiencepleasing ending the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end as the film begins we are introduced to alex ewan mcgregor juliet kerry fox and david christopher eccleston a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch a man named hugo moves into the apartments remaining vacancy and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash presumably from criminal activities the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death after a drawing of straws the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film and part of what makes shallow grave so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next other than the obvious question of why they dont report the death and simply hide the cash which is not addressed the plotting and characterization while sometimes predictable worked in a way that kept my attention and on more than one occasion gave me chills i will therefore attempt to continue this review in a way that doesnt give away too much of the plot broadly the trio are in danger due to hugos underworld connections as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process a police inspector ken stott is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective david meanwhile becomes increasingly paranoid moves into the attic and develops an affinity for sharp objects director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other while i do not consider myself the happy endings are automatically stupid type i thought that shallow grave really should have ended in tragedy a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison in the mental hospital or in the morgue this could have been accomplished quite credibly but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional caper ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom and nothing more granted this isnt really a happy ending but its still pretty lighthearted compared to what preceded it i really shouldnt say anything more about the ending as far as details go but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable yes this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes but ultimately it left me feeling as if id been cheated still shallow grave was brilliant most of the way through and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller and i am therefore awarding it three stars i guess i just cant help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away ',?
'the happy bastards second review big daddy happy gilmore as a father of course thats the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy a movie thats passable but isnt really considered some of sandlers best work he doesnt actually play happy gilmore in the movie but a variation of him hes sonny coufax a man whos living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his onedayaweek gig as a tollbooth man tollbooth willie his girlfriend kristy swanson is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him enter a year old kid whos mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate jon stewart whos off in china on a business trip from there coufax basically acts as the kids father teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker joey lauren adams but somehow he also garners the attention of social services who arent particularly pleased with coufaxs actions as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid the reason i say its not really sandlers best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie showing some odd feelings that somehow didnt really belong in a sandler vehicle i mean it fits the movies tone and everything and sandler handles it well but its just oddly placed thats all fortunately it doesnt destroy the goofy glee path its been following and it still makes you feel good sandler does a good job here as he does in most of his movies rob schneider however is irritating as his friend an immigrant delivery boy who cant read stewart in his minor time on screen is great and adams remains a joy to watch look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum hes a hoot directed by dennis dugan director of happy gilmore the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with again there are faults but hey everyone needs to get emotional sometimes ',?
'it has been years since a terrence malick film hit theaters his new film the thin red line is a strange beautiful enigmatic mess of a movie the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast it is filled with abovethetitle stars the cast for the most part gives great performances john travolta whose role is nothing more than a cameo seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve george clooney whose role became a cameo in editing gives a strange performance one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a characters narration the rest of the cast especially nick nolte and elias koteas are unambiguously fantastic these actors and they are with two exceptions men were lured by the name of malick terrence malick is a cinematic legend he has often been called the j d salinger of cinema his two previous films badlands and days of heaven are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures after he made them he disappeared for years this film marks his return what hes made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment the narration which fills the film and perplexes many not only lets us hear the narrators the characters themselves pontificate but also lets us hear such ofthemoment thoughts as im scared the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult because the story is fractured many stories are here from the clash between the lieutenant elias koteas and the savage colonel a voracious nick nolte to the private ben chaplin who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box shook the box and poured the results onto a table this basically creates a mess but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed im not declaring that the film has no structure while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about minutes of combat the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video ultimately malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature while some have said that the antiwar message and pronature tubthumping was juvenile it was done with so much complexity and thought that it cannot ever honestly be called childish after seeing the thin red line i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again ',?

'an astonishingly difficult movie to watch the last temptation of christ may be scorseses most important film and yet his most impossibly abstract as well scorsese presents the life of jesus christ through nikos kazantzakis novel which details the life of christ from approximately until the day of crucifixtion jesus of nazareth dafoe is a carpenter who opens the film making crosses so that he can escape the fate he is subjected to his destiny on earth yet he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others and subjects himself to a desert in exile in hopes that he can reach god before leaving he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene barbara hershey a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus after going to the desert christ learns his true purpose in life and what he must do aided by judas keitel he sets off on teaching the world his message along the way he meets john the baptist the rest of the prophets and tries to teach the world his message christ is also confronted by internal demons and selfdoubt as he tries to find his true purpose throughout the entire film during the story judas is the closese ally of jesus his betrayal argues the film was not out of hate but out of love in order to allow christ to die he is eventually captured and crucified as per the bibile however as he is about to die on the cross he is saved by a girl who brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene the girl is a guardian angel who is from god and who has saved him from his death jesus goes on to live a life as a man as a carpenter and does not die on the cross on his deathbed in the final moments of his life he is visited by the prophets and by judas who denounces his master for not keeping his end of the bargain judas reveals the angel to truly be the devil and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act jesus escapes from his deathbed and asks his father for forgiveness for succumbing to his last temptation visually and aurally the film is absolutely breathtaking no other director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of christs life to the screen peter gabriel contributes a score than is simply astonishing with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer the performances are simply exquisite with dafoe leading the way with a mesmerizing turn as jesus keitel although his accent is a problem is passionately brilliant fighting through language to bring the character to life the visuals are also amazing scorsese frames his movie in a harsh tone leaving the impression that jesus truly is a man who is having human frailties the film though has many trouble spots paul schraders script is one schrader uses modernday new york english to tell the story along with new york words new york mannerisms and new york slang speech the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ there is no underlying message behind the mans words the film fails to capture the glory and splendor of christ had it faithfully explored that aspect than the dichotomy of jesus soul his frailties and doubt mixed with his unmistakable glory would have been simply spectacular the message of christ is confused between love and violence and the film merely tells us jesus is great instead of showing us his greatness the film is also overlong it just drags in the middle with nothing truly happening christ is a confused figure in the sense that the audience doesnt know who he really is schrader forgets to give jesus a message to show that he truly is the messiah to give him the divinity without that he is a rambling prophet who the audience themselves do not believe there are several moments of accidental hilarity and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach there are moments of brief awe and power followed by moments of confused hilarity that said the controversial temptation sequence is something to behold it is a step in an unexpected direction one that leaves the audience puzzled until the arrival of the disciples it is a simply breathtaking scene with jesus about to die as a mortal it is truly one of scorseses finest moments it is unfortunate that scorsese couldnt make a film about christ as powerful as that one scene ',?

' warning to those who have not seen seven this review contains some spoiler information seven is a powerful fullyrealized film on the level of the silence of the lambs it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goalsit occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled while this film is not for the squeamish there is no denying that seven demands attention for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance for starters seven as a thriller would not be an altogether complete of this film while i was genuinely thrilled throughout i would rather call seven an intense drama because that is what it deliversmeaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as simple as a corpse and visually fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in alltoorealistic and graphic terms courtesy of rob bottins alwaysgrisly special effects throw in the appropriate but nottobeunderestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene these scenes alone are quite impressive as fascinating as they are harrowing yet seven is more than just a technical accomplishment in addition to style fincher supplies substance seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society detective william somerset morgan freeman is a man who has nearly given up on the world its easy to see why the world doesnt make sense somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct after knocked down and robbed of his wallet the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and picking up the pieces he will be able to catch the killer somersets new partner david mills brad pitt has not given up on the world perhaps because he is still young and perhaps by having this optimism hes naive in this films portrayal of the world he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope however davids wife gwyneth paltrow has so much fear of her urban surroundings she isnt even sure if she wants to tell her husband about her recent pregnancy let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment these three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world fincher gives us support for why they feel the way they do but if theres one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey it has to be the killer john doe kevin spacey sevens payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a psycho with no motives behind his slayings this is exactly the mistake mills makes in the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes were allowed to see that doe is in his mind merely a product of society hes a killer who kills those who are bringing society down in his mind he didnt kill innocent people and perhaps they were not completely innocent but then again who is hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent really seven doesnt just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwedup john doe is seven makes larger statements about how screwedup society is hinting that societys degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does besides the stylistic and largerissue arguments for seeing this film i recommend seven because it is after all also a very slick and wellmade thriller it features exciting plot developments commanding performances lots of suspense and a conclusion that is chilling riveting and quite unfair but then again its a cruel world ',?

'as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it the more pleased i was when i left first getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz if you liked scream youll love wild things campbell gives a stunning performance this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days oh yeah the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me now onto more serious stuff and with this film i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way wild things has singlehandedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa im not saying that in a bad way but when you see this film you may be shocked by what you see however perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the films charming cast and tricky plot that they let the film slide with an r rating being mormon im bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film trouble is i have already seen it and i like it wild things is a film noir of the s filled with s sensibilities and yet breaking the rules and modernday taboos of s culture the style in which it is filmed is rich in color the actors are all gorgeous people seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film sure its all too good to be true but aint it fun to watch when movies like this come along sort of a better version of basic instinct there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it there will be people who dont want to admit liking what they see but i tell you most anyone who sees this will like it wild things begins at blue bay high school the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into its almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance totally based on looks alone of course there are those select few who may look slightly ugly but compared to the average person they are gorgeous immediately the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time we can turn off our brains right wrong while you may be expecting one thing to happen it certainly doesnt turn out that way the film begins in a with nearly all the main characters present theres sam lombardo matt dillon a counselor for the students hes heading the discussion theres also kelly van ryan denise richards a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam teaching the however are two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubinvega who want to talk about sex cheers crimes boos what is a sex crime ray asks not gettin any one student responds this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch however upon hearing this one student suzie toller neve campbell stands up and leaves the room commenting that they can both kiss part of her body and so wild things sets into motion quickly kelly begins hitting on sam but sam doesnt want anything to do with her advances kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep surprisingly thats really all i can tell you about the plot any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists and whats more these plot twists are actually unpredictable going along the way of scream wild things maintains that films surprises and then adds even more to them there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen and even though you think you may get tired of them the surprises are so genuine that its rather pleasing going back over them in my mind nearly all of them work though some stretch the boundaries of belief thankfully the convoluted plot doesnt give us much time to think about each one pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off as for the critics who complain that the film is trashywell it is this is pretty much just one trashy film however it is the kind of trashy that isnt hard to watch its good trash in a sense one the screenplay knows that its not to be taken seriously and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story this varies everywhere from kellys mother theresa russell who is more of a caricature of rich people all the way to an ambulancechasing lawyer bill murray who wears a neckbrace to cover an insurance scam he is running bill murray also provides the best character in the film and most of the genuine laughs and two the sex is more than gratuitous although not unwelcomed wild things is supposed to have sex in it what film with that title wouldnt and this movie breaks the boundaries instead of having heterosexual sex scenes it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell dont worry its not as graphic as you might think the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic but the surprise shocker is kevin bacons fullfrontal nude scene its very brief so if you blink you may miss ahem it and for as long as i can remember i dont think i have seen an rrated film show an erect one before its not completely but judging from the audiences reaction it was more than they expected too also during one scene late in the film there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillons characters but nothing came of it makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating or if the actors refused to do it what first made me want to see wild things was its cast neve campbell of course has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released here however she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead the closest role to this was her performance in the craft though even in that she was a nice girl campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent you can tell she will be around for a long time denise richards will also be around for a long time although she may be limited to the roles without much range here she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff yet effective performance in starship troopers hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability and then there is daphne rubinvega a newcomer to the movies she gives a very good performance although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half towards the end she does get a bigger part on the male side matt dillon is probably the best giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character but he makes the most of it you must have admiration though for what he did on screen and judging from many of the womens reactions in the theater to that shot they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon yeah right and then there is bill murray his performance is the comic relief and he nearly steals the film as a whole the entire cast works wondrously together and they seem at home even when doing the menage a troi director john mcnaughton who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry portrait of a serial killer has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works his direction is smooth and stylish the visuals are striking filled with rich colors and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air however he seems more at home when the actors arent talking his flyby shots of the swampy areas are brilliant and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is a highlight the cinematography is gorgeous in its details its not often that you see a film like this and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures then there is the music this was probably the most obvious thing to me as it set the perfect mood for the film its hard to describe in words so just see the film and listen to it its wonderfully composed and presented and be sure to stick around during the closing credits mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use while most comedies use it for outtakes he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot but its an entertaining way to finish the film plus there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality nudity language and violence again the nudity is rather unnecessary but lets face itpeople want to see it so why not give it to them neve campbell admirably has a nonudity clause in her contract and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off way to go neve the sex scenes are graphic especially the first one we see between the mother and one of her deck hands one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating the language is quite harsh too ranging from sexual innuendo to your average everyday profanity and i cant stress it enough dont allow kids under to see this film the target age for the movie is the range and thats who should see it its definitely not for those under did i mention that this film is rated r however for those that do get a chance to watch it you will probably more likely be pleased and may even take friends to see it the next time ',?
'director penelope spheeris decline of western civilization ii the metal years dudes suburbia cast mike myers wayne campbell dana carvey garth algar rob lowe benjamin oliver tia carrere cassandra summary wayne and garth have a public access show called waynes world the show is a underground hit until benjamin oliver comes onto the scene benjamin wants to turn the show into a big hit nationwide possibly destroying the essence of waynes world in the process expectations medium long review i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film i didnt believe that they mike myers and dana carvey could hold it up for an hour and a half i figured that perhaps the first halfhour would be great and the rest would be fluff however i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film with the exception of the ending which i wont discuss for obvious reasons but its not that bad story the plot was quite thin but it really wasnt that noticeable because of the rapidfire jokes that myers wrote in alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots in being very parodyish okay bad term extremely witty throughout although as in hot shots it got a bit repetitive in the middle acting as in many comedies the acting isnt really that important however myers turns in a good performance as wayne playing the character perfectly although i still liked him better back on much music in a more canadian type of mode carvey is okay as garth but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra playing it very stilted lowe is fine as ben oliver but is nothing to write home about without a doubt this movie is mike myers all the way direction spheeris is a music movie director making dudes and decline of western civilization ii the metal years she also directed the boys next door which is different to say the least she is very capable knows how direct a comedy the correct camera movements it instill laughs etc one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy overall i would suggest to anyone that likes snls skits to go see this film in the theatres however my personal opinion as in most comedies is that they work just as well on video you definately have to be fan of music and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film without a doubt this is the best comedy so far this year itll make tons o dough for everyone involved lets just hope they make a thousand sequels sorry i had to get the lame joke in forgive me ',?
'with stars like sigourney weaver alien trilogy and academy award winner holly hunter the piano raising arizona etc together in a single hollywood production one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot sadly for copycat though tightly scripted and nicely plot is still at heart a typical hollywood thriller helen weaver after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer darryl harry connick jr has developed a phobia for being outdoors so to speak incidentally helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco detective monahan hunter and getz mulroney baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer seeks the professional help of helen who as expected was reluctant at first copycat borrows a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases it did work but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also much of the time wasted couldve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama even so weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments weaver being the vulnerable yet strongwithin character as in aliens and hunter being the short tough texan speaking cop as in raising arizona harry connick jr a very good jazz singer shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter which comes to the moment of judgement drum roll please copycat is a good thriller although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about minutes into the show copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats in anticipation of the killers next immediate move this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts nice movie to bring your girlfriend to ',?

'when i initially set out to review this film my tag line was going to be you too can believe whales can fly then it was going to be you too can believe pastel triangles can fly then it was going to be you too can believe wood sprites can fly finally i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say theres a lot of flying going on in this film as our first host steve martin tells us the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while because approximately sixty years have passed since the original was released part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in grossing somewhere close to in its original month of release subsequent rereleases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the status it has finally achieved and rightfully deserved to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before six stories high in an exclusive four month engagement from january st to april th fantasia can be seen at many imax theaters across the us after the engagement is over the film will be shown at regular theaters is the format effective for the film with a few exceptions yes the first segment we are presented with is set to beethovens fifth symphony its hard to describe exactly what this segment is about but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil black batlike triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts eventually shafts of light from above help drive away the evil batlike things and peace returns to the butterfly things though this segment isnt very story driven some of the images are very visually strong especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things who are all outlined in blood red colors begin to overtake the skies the next segment is set to ottorino respighis the pines of rome in this segment some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack he is finally saved by another liberating shaft of light and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the oceans of clouds again visuals are the key with this segment especially where the whales are involved reportedly the whales as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences are shown as actual size the cgi whales look incredibly lifelike except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent absolutely beautiful stuff the third segment and the least of the eight segments is set to george gershwins rhapsody in blue this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york theres a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer an outofwork sad sack that dreams of having a job a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife i wont go into how everything works out but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending unfortunately the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments segment four is set to dmitri shostakovichs piano concerto no and is an animated version of hans christian andersens the steadfast tin soldier a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a windup clock ballerina whom he assumes is also one legged because he cant see her other leg extended out behind her much to the dismay of an evil jackinthebox jester the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina little does the jester know the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl although the ending has been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short some children may find the jester to be a little frightening but otherwise the segment is well made segment five is the funniest of the bunch set to camille saintsaens the carnival of the animals this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yoyo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original fantasia and its the one that people remember most the sorcerers apprentice the story is the most recognizable so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo unfortunately the segment wasnt made to be presented on large format film considering it was shot full frame and exhibits large amounts of grain there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately but no one seems to notice for some strange reason an anomaly common to many plus screen theaters segment seven is set to sir edward elgars pomp and circumstance march no and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character donald duck stars as an assistant to noah whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark during the loading donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didnt make it on the boat they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tearjerkers foisted on audiences these days powerful stuff segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich saving the best for last set to igor stravinskys the firebird an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation when the sprite examines the formation it awakens and becomes the titular firebird in a stunning spectacle the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path including everything that the sprite has worked to create some amazing animation is present here and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film the host segments are largely no pun intended throwaways although steve martins clip is pretty funny be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin penn and teller are usually funny but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting the best segment comes from of all people bette midler who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board pieces like flight of the bumblebee a take on the four horsemen set to wagners ride of the valkyries and a strange segment prepared in the s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments for fans of visual stimulation or music fantasia is a perfect way to spend the afternoon the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material as i mentioned earlier in the review if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though then you too can believe that whalestriangle thingssprites can fly g ',?
'in may of just years after steven spielbergs success with jaws and years after francis coppolas the godfather a risky ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film in january of this year lucas rereleased star wars on its th anniversary in this new remastered version the added effects which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computergenerated jabba the hutt dont do much but call attention to themselves other than these the film is exactly the same why pay to see it in the theaters you might ask simply because when this movie was released most of us were a few years short of being born we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience especially if you havent seen it the plot is basic but in the same way complex it has many themes but the one rotates around luke skywalker mark hamill and his quest to become a jedi knight his mission begins when a droid named rd plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia carrie fisher which tells him to contact the mysterious obiwan kanoby alec guiness he and kanoby then joined by two intergalactic renegades hans solo harrison ford and chewbacca and skywalkers two droids d and cpo the voice of anthony edwards wage war upon the corrupt empire commanded by an evil general peter cushing and the traitorous darth vader the voice of james earl jones skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger the force the film is obviously quite starstudded but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones voice would appear so many more times in the future it just happened to work out for him the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalkers triumph is symbolized by the audiences sense of becoming something larger than life itselfa universe of fans young and old recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever ',?
'seen february on home video borrowed from chris wessell when it comes to modern gangster movies its really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre andor just using the word routine ive always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea no matter how many times its been used before can provide for a good story and donnie brasco clinches this idea its not unlike most of the great films of the genre yet it never apes anothers style as it has a good layer of authenticity even if its core is a tad stale the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late s and the mobsters who inhibit it we meet lefty pacino an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this somehow he comes across donnie brasco depp a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isnt afraid of lefty and his rep and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him its clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately telling him all the tricks of the trade i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit however we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone an fbi agent working undercover a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor a brief history of the mob definitions of their slang and where their money comes from and who it goes to the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements however the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works probably from watching other gangster movies and although this attitude comes across the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable thankfully the film doesnt become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime and instead opts for character development much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would hes old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over years might be we learn of his accomplishments which are quite impressive within their context and when he complains about not being made top boss its easy to sympathize with him newell constantly plays up this aspect making it a major theme which works well in the long run as donnie is constantly impressing and even oneupping lefty its hard to tell which emotion is more powerful the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed most of the film tells the story of donnies life in mafia which creates for many subplots and individual conflicts but doesnt always seem to come together as a whole the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar the resonance to donnies actual assignment varies he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress but it doesnt always seem to have much meaning back home his wife maggie heche is ready to divorce him because hes never a and the family is suffering since this is based on a true story i wouldnt doubt this would happen although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act or at least any real sense of closure a climax of sorts does occur but theres little feeling of a payoff we get a happy ending which is good but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful aside from a few minor general flaws donnie brasco manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development it may be routine but its good and thats respectful ',?

'in chocolat a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures patterns and lines hoping shell be able to foresee the kind of chocolate theyll most enjoy some scoff the idea but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole on the surface it appears to be a light fluffy fable with no depth or true worth but when one takes a second deeper look chocolats true colors begin to shine through making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it lasse hallstroms chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously craftednot to mention one of the best films of the year what gives chocolat its magic much like hallstroms winner of two academy awards the cider house rules is its willingness to say whats on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrowmindedness chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet where majority rules and the majority lives by only one law religion the bulk of the townspeople with few exceptions are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence lent but when the independent thinking seemingly nonreligious vianne rocher juliette binoche and her daughter anouk victoire thivisol make the village their home the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouthwatering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by viannes opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent especially the mayor comte de reynaud a cartoonlike alfred molina who will stop at nothing to put her out of business on the other hand the shop is a delight to others including the cranky armande voizin judi dench who sits day by day in viannes shop telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson aurelien parentkoening which comes as a result of his mother carrieann moss believing armande is a bad influence as she does not hold the same strict religious beliefs that she does also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat whose husband is constantly beating her to whom vianne offers a home and befriends juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne genuinely capturing her characters determination to turn the narrowminded townspeople into more happy independent human beings but most of chocolats success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses lena olin previously nominated for an oscar in deserves her second nomination for her earnest moving portrayal of a lost scared woman torn between staying true to her battering manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs judi dench is sharp incisive and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin carrie annmoss in what is likely to be her first largely noticed and acclaimed role since the matrix shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk a young girl hoping her alwaysonthemove mother will eventually settle down a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline five extraordinary women one extraordinary movie thats not to say the men dont do their share though alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist hugh oconor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric fairy tale look to the film and rachel portmans masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules chocolat adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel is a wonderful little treat of a film one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter while not as powerful as the cider house rules lasse hallstroms chocolat is a film which works on all levelsas a drama a comedy a fable a romance and a fairy tale and it even lives up to its name it is delicious to savor the taste of easy to digest and like all excellent chocolate it is memorable for days afterward the bottom line chocolat is pure pleasure ',?

'when andy leaves for cowboy camp his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys one of these toys is wheezy a penguin with a broken squeaker woody tom hanks saddles up andys dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy woody succeeds in his mission but doesnt make it back to the house before al the unscrupulous owner of als toy barn recognizes woody as a rare collectors item and steals him buzz lightyear tim allen leads hamm john ratzenberger mr potato head don rickles slinky dog jim varney and rex wallace shawn into the city to find their friend meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped al has collected every piece of merchandising from the s tv puppet show woodys roundup except for a woody doll now that the collection is complete al plans to sell woody and his roundup gangbullseye the horse jessie the cowgirl joan cusack and stinky pete the old prospector kelsey grammer to a toy museum in japan the gang is happy about the move theyve been in storage for years waiting for woody if woody doesnt go with them theyll be closed up in a dark box again possibly forever trying to convince him to stay with them jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy buzz and the boys invade als toy barn where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesnt know hes a toy the new buzz generates the movies biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on zurgs fortress i e als apartment building the original toy story won me over because its central themes reflected a grownup sensibility rather than the usual thisiswhatwethinkkidswanttohear while most kids movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill in toy story buzz discovered that he wasnt special that he was just like everyone else buzz sank into a suicidal depression but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy in other words its okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that were not space rangers and were never going to be toy story addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded abandoned or sealed up in a dark box in the attic this is another big grownup theme everything ends the theme is introduced early in the movie when woodys arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp on the shelf woody meets wheezy whos dusty broken and forgotten the other toys are shocked that woody has been shelved and they worry that woodys ride out to the cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt after hes stolen woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals of course in spite of the heavy themes toy story explores its also very funny most of the laughs come from the toys assault on als toy barn and on the apartment building the brief substitution of a new still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise id wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original most of the vocal performances are firstrate tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work however one voiceover also stands out as horribly miscast kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector although he does a lot of voiceover work in commercials and on the simpsons as sideshow bob grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice he doesnt have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete the animation is even better than in the first especially impressive were the textures of the figures we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic in the first movie the people looked just like the toys but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint we can also see that bo peep is porcelain as you can tell from the longwinded phrasing common in the merchandising disney and pixars toy story this is pixars coming out party to celebrate they appended their first project a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball to the beginning of the movie they made the short in which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then on the downside toy story follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale and some sections tend to drag overall though i had a great time and found story to be a worthy successor to the first toy story bottom line this one really is fun for the whole family ',?

'many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come the new film by visionary director vincent ward most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors but little do they know as i so plainly found out that this has quite a complex story to tell walking out of the theater i could see the audiences disgust one member even had to be awakened after the film ended dont believe the previews that you see this is definitely not a film for everyone this is quite possibly one of the most adultoriented films to come out in recent years kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us it goes back and forth in time as if it has no boundaries think of the film city of angels now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision both films deal with the afterlife but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office costing around million to make the film would have to do extremely well in order to make its money back but due to its story i doubt it will for everyone who thought titanics story was too simple and cliche here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay it may not have done nearly as well but dont get me wrong i hope the film does do well its a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen i doubt most of us could have thought of this place even in our own mind what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals the only film that surpasses it is dark city full of rich shocking colors we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to but dont do that because youll end up going to hell what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake chris christy nielsen robin williams is startled by the sudden jolt but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat annie annabella sciorra spies chris as well and both eventually bond and get married annie is an artist whose paintings are colorful lush and surrealistic chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself they also have two children marie jessica brooks and ian josh paddock but one day the two children are killed in a car crash and it almost destroys annie she tries to commit suicide but fails and is then put in an institution chris copes with the problem by realizing they arent around anymore and nothing will change that just as annie gets her life back in order chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim chris goes to heaven or his version of heaven rather guided by albert cuba gooding jr chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy that is until he realizes how miserable he is without annie prior to heaven he would try to comfort annie but the more he was around the more pain she felt chris decides to leave her alone little does he realize what will happen next im not about to say because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story many critics however give it away certainly chris dying is crucial to the plot but they tell you that he dies in the previews story is not necessarily important for this movie to work because it deals with the afterlife however strangely virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil a couple of comments here and there but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life were soul mates chris exclaims heaven in movies is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white purity and love usually it also looks like it rests among the clouds but what dreams may come goes a different route it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before chris heaven is his memories brought to life his thoughts can make anything real and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven ive never seen anyone use real paint before albert says equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone instead its a state of being in one gloriously horrific scene chris and his tracker max von sydow arrive at a sea of faces thousands of heads are stuck above ground their bodies somewhere else mostly dead silent some quips are made almost as if to lighten the mood its truly a frightening sequence production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination using state of the art computer technology worlds are created for exploration sometimes some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact its not necessary to be there but we appreciate seeing it costume designer yvonne blake who also appears in the film has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes cinematographer eduardo serra whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove has a difficult job as most cinematographers do working with special effects but serras entire universe is a computer generated image and he does a masterful job writer ron bass adapting from the novel by richard matheson provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot the story is extremely vague in its details allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience your average movie goer more than likely isnt used to expressionistic techniques the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people but they shouldnt take it too far it is after all just a movie robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances while his comedic roles have been suffering his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff but when is confined by a screenplay he isnt quite as effective but drama is really his strong point and you can see that here its doubtful hell get another oscar nomination but i wouldnt really mind if he did the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention its also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination however the academy doesnt like to award performances for these types of films cuba gooding jr has been better but hes certainly not distracting max von sydow is underused as are jessica brooks and josh paddock a treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear if they even recognize him as chris father lost in the sea of faces its not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images overall its williams and sciorras film what dreams may come is rated pg for thematic elements involving death some disturbing images language and some partial nudity the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience some will find the plot distracting some will find the visuals absolutely glorious and some will find both the only real problem with the film that i could see was that it slows down considerably during the midsection just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins by the way some controversy even surrounded the title which was mistaken for a sexual term what becomes wet and you should understand in actuality the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet just thought i should let you know ',?

'for this review and more visit clear illusions www clearillusions com the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music worn out dialogue such as ill be right back or simply with the overall tone of the scene how about a john denver song as a death signal for a change thats the kind of bursting originality that allows final destination to invade the viewers mind even days after seeing it making one pause before ever entering a dark room taking a shower or even going to sleep the unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing to happen to the slasher genre since s scream final destination directed by james wong and penned by jeffrey riddick glen morgan and james wong the latter two being writers for the t v series the xfiles is a movie with wonderful ideas and executes them effortlessly its rare a film of this nature can grab an audiences attention these days as the genre has seem to be completely worn out but final destination has more in store for one than one can imagine unlike halloween s michael myers or nightmare on elm street s freddy kruger final destination s killer is of the supernatural the dark one himself death the intriguing premise is as follows a portion of a senior is set to travel by air to paris for their trip after boarding the plane one of the students alex browning devon sawa dreams of their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff killing everyone on board once waking up alex gets himself and six others off of that plane all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire happening shortly after their departure the plane takes off and guess what it blows up in middair now alex and fellow survivors who consist of friend clear waters ali larter enemy carter kerr smith carters girlfriend terry amanda detmer the goofy billy sean william scott and his brother tod chad donella and teacher ms valerie lewton kristen cloke are in extreme danger as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane and now death wants them the number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing those who got off the plane but who is next and how will death get them final destination is a film that is unbearably suspenseful always making the viewer frantic as death will strike in the most unlikely of times john denvers rocky mountain high being played pretty much warrants another death everyone on that plane learned the hard way although its usually given whose life will be taken next the intensity and unpredictability of the film never fades because you dont know when death is coming like the characters in the movie i was constantly nervous and shaky during final destination the slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into the air and yes the film is that intense the cast is surprisingly effective and up to par the best ensemble in this genre since scream the characters have multidimensional personalities for a change and for the most part you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way devon sawa and ali larter are the main focus of the film and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances that like the scream movies did for their cast will launch them into superstardom kerr smith and kristen cloke are also impressive although the two dont posses as much screen time as the leads final destination is one exhilarating exciting ride any age should be able to enjoy the complexity and eeriness of the film and should find an edge to it that most slasher films lack for the blood loving moviegoer destination contains buckets of blood guts and all that good stuff final destination is a film that is destined to become a cult among horror fans and a sleeper hit at the box office hands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me by scare i dont mean making me jump or making me wonder if im in danger but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind absorbing you leaving one question thats constantly on your mind is death coming for me the bottom line make final destination your destination ',?
'in brief this film needs no introduction if you havent heard of it then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical and if you havent seen it well i suspect youre in a small minority first things first is it all its hyped up to be well yes and no its a good film and theres a lot to like about it but its not without its problems when i saw the first trailer for titanic it was when i went to see bean last summer i think my intial reaction was aint that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful reallife tragedy i mean whats happened to hollywoods scriptwriters have they run entirely out of new ideas gads whatever next i asked myself how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme i was not entirely filled with anticipation but then i wasnt alone in that respect its when it came out in the cinema to rave reviews well mostly and anyone whod been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice i didnt see the film until several months after its release by which time my sister had seen it about four times so i went with a slightly more open mind but i still didnt think id enjoy it much did i yes and no mainly yes im happy to say the first hour or so was beautifully done not so much because of the scripting ill talk about that later but because the recreated ship and sets were stunning to look at as was camerons directing and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the human aspect of the story the romance between rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio was enchanting the film is told via flashback with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day you knew that a course well its an often effective device to use in storytelling though sometimes it can fall flat does it work here in script form it doesnt add all that much to the story what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart whose stunning performance is the strongest most moving of the film her presence brings a much deeper level of passion and depth to the story and though her appearances are relatively brief the film would have suffered without her also impressive are dicaprio and winslet who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving its an old story you know forbidden love ala romeo and juliet but it works and jacks rescuing rose in both literal and figurative senses and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching in fact i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm energy to the romance its engaging touching and very enjoyable theres more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well simply because you know its not going to be a happy ending which leads us to the second half of the film we all knew it was coming im sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it because as hes stated in interviews the real thrust of the story for him was the sinking and the jackrose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film i think that understates the importance of the romance as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die the iceberg arrives and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour and it is an hour my goodness we dont miss a second of that hour gratuitous well perhaps not by todays standards im sure theres been far worse produced under the banner of entertainment in other films but i certainly wasnt prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be not that id expect the word understatement to be part of camerons vocabulary he who brought us such umm vivid films as terminator and aliens is it overdone i thought so understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy no no one expected a happy ending but i didnt quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the films second half still whether it was overdone and heavyhanded or not if it was the shockfactor cameron was after it worked because i was shocked and moved in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears you really couldnt help but get emotionally involved whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of roses overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack or that jack would rescue rose or that they would both survive perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface the bit where rose lets go of jacks hand while promising shell never let go in her heart was particularly heartwrenching and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image to put no fine a point on it i loved the ending however which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half so weve established that the film is powerful and moving if the last hour was rather excessive havent mentioned the script plotwise its ok though the jackrose relationship was beautifully developed but ive a feeling thats to the actors credit if anything as for the dialogue well titanic is set in its a period drama but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned did they really use phrases like goddamn it back in the turn of the century i doubt it would someone talk like this do ya love the guy or what i doubt it is such dialogue as i saw the iceberg and i see it in your eyes now not just a bit clumsy yes it is a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray and cameron himself is to blame he wrote the script stick with directing dude but its more than redeemed by the acting with dicaprio and winslet on fine form ably supported by a strong cast star of the show was gloria stuart though why didnt she win that oscar after all they were throwing oscars at titanic left right and centre but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee directingwise cameron does a spectacular job like i said his vision was a bit excessive but at least he directed it well i havent even mentioned james horners beautiful score utterly heavenly though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ive finished my rant which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would just leaves a couple of questions was it worth all those oscars hell dont talk to me about oscars bloomin farce it was deserving in a number of departments though last question is it as some suggest one of the best films of alltime nope i dont think so its certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films ive ever seen but i dont think it quite ranks as one of my alltime favourites and as for the fact theyre reportedly making a titanic well i guess thats typical hollywood for you ',?
'i have a soft spot in my heart for pure amoral sleaze i liked showgirls there i said it i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz sexfilled cinematic tabloidish trash wild things is the best sleazy film ive ever seen its filled with great performances graphic sex threeway sex rape charges doublecrosses plot twists genitalia of all genders graphic violence death witty humor and best of all denise richards criticizing this film for being disgusting raucous and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing or titanic for being lofty and epic wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors but i dont just admire it for thisi admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies i must admit upfront however that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal i imagine that this shows its hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldnt be known i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer but i was wrong there are a lot of turns here ill just say that the film takes place in blue bay a rich little town in florida in blue bay lives sam lombardo matt dillon a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students kelly van ryan denise richards and suzie toller neve campbell kellys mother sandra theresa russell immediately presses charges all of this happens fairly early in the film and right up until this point i had the whole film predicted i was wrong though and every time i was proven wrong i was shocked wild things isnt even remotely plausible but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless and often invited just for kicks i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers id give the preview four stars it made me want to see the movie so much that ive been waiting for it anxiously ever since over the past few weeks though i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview see independence day thankfully i was proven wrong the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company not only does it make us want to see the film but it doesnt give away any of the secrets but im not here to talk about the preview im here to talk about denise richards now i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene shes in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can of course this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes and flawless body but i thought she did a great job acting too stop laughing no richards is truly a findshe is talented and always convincing in this film this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future the other actors are good too dillon is as suave as ever its nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in out bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them though i wont pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex for a plot like this to work all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived thats okay because director john mcnaughton knows that hes making a selfconsciously wicked film each sceneeven the threeway sex sceneis observed with hilarity by mcnaughton and the result is a sleazefest thats too smart to resist there isnt an inconsistent moment in wild things every bit of it is alluring garbage so trashy its funny and so entertaining its painful i loved it ',?
'what is a scary movie anyhow is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer what ever happened to horror movies where the horror was in the atmosphere and in the characters movies like halloween and psycho which revolutionized horror genre forever but wait in came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty entitled the exorcist the movie opened to rave reviews and scared audiences to death now in the year the exorcist comes back to the big screen in a version youve never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan while working on a new film chris still stays close to regan but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon she shuns at the fact of it but considers getting a priest to help her daughter father karras jason miller is the man they bring in his mother has just died and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl christ father karras and their nanny sharon kitty winn have to sit and wait until a man shows up that man is the exorcist and that man will help this little girl excrutiatingly scary the exorcist is a horror film which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death now we get to the experience the exorcist the way it was meant to be seen in a directors cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time a new ending has been added as well and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie which i prefer the original darker ending more the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix and is amazing the voices are all clear the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness as a director friedkin has been well known for other films but his standout film is the exorcist nominated for several academy awards it one a few but was somehow doubted best picture best actress ellen burstyn and best supporting actress linda blair who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl alone possessed and unable to stop what is going on ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date and can be seen currently in requiem for a dream to which she is getting rave reviews for jason miller jason patriks dad is amazing as father karras and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie i in no way think that this movie is comical yes some of the stuff regan says is funny but they were laughing at her head spinning and the green pea soup come on people this is some creepy stuff anyway the rerelease of the film has managed to make million dollars and is still going hopefully one day they rerelease it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy ',?
'with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up loading their guns kissing each other and uttering what sounds like rock and roll actually its lock and load you cant help thinking tarantino and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie clyde to natural born killers but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon inspired by true events weve heard that one before and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated or so strangely poignant for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged beginning with their final arrest the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris luke perry a policeman and pam ashley judd a factory worker they fall in love and marry but pams increasingly erratic behaviour going on spending sprees slashing herself with a knife after an argument begin to trouble the solid and stable chris when chris gets sacked they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up then chris begins to rob banks luke perry accomplishes the notinconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills or buffy the vampire slayer moustached with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation he is perfectly cast as the longsuffering husband its another of john mcnaughtons coups of castingagainsttype after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person if the performance falls short of greatness however it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema whether its in betty blue tom viv or georgia as in those movies theres the danger that the performance seems mannered a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece judd doesnt entirely avoid this pitfall but pams craziness is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more normal chris when pam reacts to her fatherinlaws death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones chris face is the picture of pained restraint of course its the question of what is normal that is asked in normal life mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity it is the rational chris that loves guns shooting is about precision control and the crazy pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog who is then called chaos chaos and you and me were a real family she notes wryly it is chris methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber his wellplanned disguise as a bearded roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background buymore the perfectly respectable consumptioncrazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases and both of them into desperate situations its not a perfect film some of the dialogue is a touch too banal perhaps intentionally the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pams crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film indeed as in mcnaughtons seminal film henry portrait of a serial killer it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre that gives this determinedly unflashy moving film its great strengths mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet coolly realistic method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer the suburbs with their miles of whitefenced houses and identikit malls take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness in its very different way this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malicks badlands while pam shares the yearnings of malicks heroes to escape from ordinary life chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a normal life their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies but these are dreams defined by constrained by and even doomed by the limitations of the normal conventional world pams final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs where wild bushes grow symbolically the frontier the outer limits of her society but also quite literally the end of the road where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement the flying inkpots rating system wait for the video a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice ',?

'titantic writer and director james camerons much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed epic arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises whether the film is worth it as a business proposition it seems hard to see how it can ever break even but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful if youve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure think again the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the worlds most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers in either case it is filmmaking at its best when we entered the press screening my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long he said no but that the time would go by so fast shed never notice the length amazingly he was right titanic is one of the few long films that doesnt suffer because of it the lush picture filmed by russell carpenter in mm opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean fortune hunter brock lovett bill paxton leads the expedition looking for the worlds most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship known back then as the ship of dreams the necklaces hundredyearold former owner rose dewitt bukater gloria stuart finds brock to tell him her story although almost all of the movie happens in flashback one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk using a computer simulation the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing after twenty minutes the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage in a movie theme the two parts of the ship first and steerage exist in sharp contrast the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance cal hockley played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third even with her own promenade deck rose feels trapped on the ship what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes in contrast jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board after jack saves rose from committing suicide they start a brief but impassioned love affair never tawdry and rarely explicit their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma in so many ways small and large he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part when he confronts cal for example he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cals supercilious putdowns kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose the chemistry between these two academy award nominees him for whats eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility is nothing short of astonishing from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ships bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances if the film breaks after an hour and a half which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up you will still get one of the best films of the year peter lamonts sets are more than authentic one scene for example starts with the planningtoretire captain played with insouciance by bernard hill having his tea on deck it then shifts to the ships massive gears and then to the brighthot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest at first since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull not some big gaping hole the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else what a lark weve struck an iceberg now lets get back to our brandy and cigars the ships musicians play like troopers through it all even after the panic sets in after all they see it as their duty to calm the passengers when the musicians are about to die they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together and they mean it their civility borders on insanity but it is touching nevertheless the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface there are more than enough characters to love and to hate and all of the casting is deadon special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable in titanic for which he created a ninetenths scale model of the entire ship cameron strove for accuracy at all costs the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two and the front section becomes vertical in the water people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately besides being romantic and dramatic the script includes liberal doses of humor from the many deliciously subtle verbal putdowns to the physical comedy as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears its goodbye for a little while a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first this boats for mommies and children therell be a boat in a little while for daddies basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats it made the decks look too crowded otherwise perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheims onboard the ship in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew no thanks the elegantly attired guggenheim replies were dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen but we would like a brandy titanic runs it is rated pg for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up ',?
'barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a couple of weeks on the surface hes coming home for a high school reunion but since this is a movie you know that hes really looking for some major life decisions a fairly small film this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman rosie odonnell and a bunch of actors that youve seen before but cant quite place commendable jobs all around they seem like real people hutton arrives at his past and is greeted by his spiritdead father terminally goony brother and old high school chums all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business and most are in the midst of a relationship crisis the perfect stuff for a comedy about people in the twenties angst he meets and falls for the new next door neighbor a beautiful intelligent lively girl who is obviously taken with him the problem is that she is only unconsummated no its not that type of movie their relationship builds and neither knows what to do with it starcrossed lovers with no where to go so hutton is gaga over a barelyteen one of his buddies is twotiming his girlfriend with a married old flame anothers girlfriend is sleeping with a meat cutter and shes a vegetarian things are a mess enter uma thurman the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight in the film and one of its minor downfalls her character is fun to watch even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her like the lone ranger before she leaves she solves most of the problems and sets everyone onward with their lives the ending is a bit too pat everything is tied up with a neat little bow rosie odonnell is a standout in her limited screen time with her brash personality and tell it like it is pronouncements structured somewhat like a diner a few years later this feelgood story is a good time but ends a little too nice ',?

'accepting his oscar as producer of this years best picture winner saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over one could almost say the same about his muchprized film rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery symbolism ideas and metaphors complex and literate storytelling all possessed of an intelligence that invites even demands constant scrutiny an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth in short the antithesis of all things hollywood yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind ralph fiennes is the title character an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory and particularly the memory of love is the ostensible focus of the film but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld the same can easily be said for every other character in the film of which there are too many juliette binoches nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious disfigured dying stranger even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion however that it verges on the comical with so many characters enjoying so little screen time the films minutes can be taxing yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldnt help but feel that greatness was in the air hints of it were everywhere in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modernday swimmer in the sahara in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years but ultimately the emotional truths writerdirector anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed in the end i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron a haunting bore bore is perhaps too strong a word but after drinking in the rich production values the cup remains only slightly over halffull ',?

'before you read my review you gotta know that i love woody allen this is a very important note because allens films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius while others see him as a dirty ol schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again i love most of his films but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the s in fact why he felt the need to make movies in those years is beyond me if you look at the quality of those films youll hear what im saying the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives in fact i secretly hoped that he would take some time off at the turn of the millennium just to reenergize or something but it doesnt appear as though he has any intention of doing that so here i am again reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old plot the year is and woody allen is a topnotch insurance investigator his methods are very oldfashioned and apparently out of date a new employee hunt has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency the two do not like each other one night they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician and unbeknownst to them placed under his control soon thereafter jewels are stolen words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer critique a wonderful recreation of the s style movies with the fasttalking witty banter between coworkers a catchy jazz score moving things along film noirish elements such as the veronica laketype sexpot oneliners galore and a fluffy if inconsequential plotline on the downside the film actually starts off pretty slowly with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy the sets on the other hand were amazing the production design and costumes were perfect and the casting ideal so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man but it wasnt not long before i was fully engaged by the characters entertained by the many zingers delivered backandforth between allen and hunt and actually interested in the resolution of the flick i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old parody and actual reinvention note therons entire female persona that is drenched in film noir very cool of course films like this with little or no real tension in the plot need solid actors to keep you interested in the quickfire dialogue and once again allen does a great job in playing his character who for once isnt his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude he actually plays a macho guy here and handles it pretty well especially the scenes in which hes hypnotized but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt an actress who i was openly sick of seeing in movies late last year sorry babe you were just in too many at the same time anyway shes really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men and doesnt miss a beat of allens fastpaced dialogue i didnt care much for her running joke about him dying whenever he left a room but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did yum yum harumph but i digress so lets recap a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score some funny oneliners especially in the second half a decent plotline although you shouldnt expect a real mystery or anything and some solid acting all around i cant say that this is even remotely close to any of allens best work but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through its probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute oldschool kind of vibe with chemistry between the leads zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion little known facts about this film and its stars annie hall celebrity everyone says i love you husbands and wives mighty aphrodite small time crooks when harry met sally youve got mail ',?
'its ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original directors cut of the film films such as aliens the abyss the wild bunch blade runner and terminator are all prime examples of a filmmakers integrity later chopped up or mucked with by the studio the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such films the dvd release of the original international version of luc bessons masterpiece the professional which is known as l on around the world is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant as a directors cut for years i have heard of an international version available only in laserdisc format which has eluded me for years i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for bucks just to watch certain directors cuts including l on but after countless searches in laserdisc stores i could never find it until now the film follows the story of l on played by jean reno a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello he lives next door to a ferociously independent yearold girl named mathilda played by then newcomer natalie portman whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops one day a crew of the cops lead by gary oldman in an overthetop performance kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries taking pity on her l on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life mathilda learns of l ons hit man profession and decides to follow in l ons footsteps as a cleaner she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l on he has kept locked away as part of his profession at this point the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in the international version contains an additional minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l on and mathilda footage that american censors deemed too explicit i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathildas and l ons motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops theres even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jeanhugues anglade star of queen margot bessons la femme nikita and killing zoe with these additional scenes replaced l on and matildas relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes the film becomes primarily a heavy emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional throw down twenty bucks and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece directorwriter luc besson producer luc besson claude besson starring jean reno natalie portman gary oldman danny aiello ',?

'there must be some unwritten rule that states one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere in the exotic morocco of a yearold english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girls the yearold lucy carrie and the yearold bea bella has arrived for a years stay with the selfabsorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold oneroom london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech at least she says she is as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers she has not planned things out too carefully having no money and the trip doesnt seem like its much fun more like a misadventure with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in drugs a worldwide youthful phenomena during this period where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities even though drugs are illegal there but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here in this film the subject of drugs is never broached only hinted at in an offhanded but slurring way as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons to follow the mystical sufis seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freuds granddaughter esther freud who traveled here in the s with her mother and sister it is written by the directors brother who has previously directed regeneration the playboys and trojan eddie the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls the girls readily accept him and there is no bigtodo made about their openly sexual relationship but the girls really dont know what to make of the relationship it especially bothers bea who is embarrassed by her mothers loose attitude and wants to go home things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village it seems only that bilals charm is matched by his shiftlessness as he has a wife who still lives there this scene didnt make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people also but i doubt that the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a normal girl the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes expansive views illustrious mosques and grand sunsets kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences as many a dropout reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves the familys travel which is on the edge has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting but when she gets up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thoughts it will dawn on her when bea takes ill as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him the new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldnt comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tears are memories a gift from god the films weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia the storyline about a helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same babyboom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pass her by her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldnt have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey after all the mystical trip is the journey the films strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcomings bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity the little girls are precocious but they are lovable julia the cornerstone the film is built on is a mother who cares about the children but doesnt know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where shes at this is a very freudian way to look at things as this sudden realization that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being and after all is said and done whos to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences just like she probably was ',?

'bruce willis and sixth sense director m night shyamalan reteam to tell the story of david dunne willis a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of to make things even stranger dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed a comic book art dealer named elijah price samuel l jackson who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child dunne doesnt believe him at first but price assists him in discovering his powers and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is writerdirector m night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years for shyamalan the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash though the answer to that question is not a very easy one either as far as pacing goes the sixth sense seemed almost interminable it wasnt until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally and perfectly paced in order to give the audience ample time to reconnect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached for unbreakable shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which in many ways blows away the film that had come before the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalans direction is excellent with the camera almost constantly moving there are tons of great shots in the film not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis character and another train passenger the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak also very impressive is the films score by james newton howard who also scored shyamalans sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes as well as this years dinosaur several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to exercise his powers the music in combination with the stellar visuals really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year this one would be it the film also boasts some great performances including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne who just cant seem to figure out why hes been depressed for the last few years his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him but he eventually grows into his own under elijahs tutelage jackson is one of the better actors of our time and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah though his hairstyle is absurd jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked robin wright penns role seems slightly underwritten but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her characters need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again spencer treat clark as the dunnes young son jeremy shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film out of all the characters jeremys is perhaps the most emotional and clark does a great job with the role where the film does lose points though is during its surprise ending shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense but i found myself saying that was it when unbreakable revealed its own ending its not that the ending is bad its just that the ending doesnt quite have the emotional punch that the other films did plus it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels and i wont reveal the ending here but youll understand what i mean when you see it essentially what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable the only real problem is that the ending doesnt quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor as long as it isnt held to the standard that sixth sense set which it ultimately will be it should be a remarkably well liked film one thing seems clear though shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film ',?

'ingredients downonhisluck evangelist church synopsis sonny dewey robert duvall is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife farrah fawcett in bed with another guy in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guys head and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder and estranged from his wife and two kids to atone for his sins sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature the apostle e f as the apostle e f sonnys main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple but sonny knows his time is short one day the police will find him opinion this movie is a thoughtprovoking look at an evangelist in real life terms i believe that robert duvall who is the producer director writer and main star of the apostle deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film duvalls portrayal of a true believer is authentic superb and inspired it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion as well as a portrait of a fallible complicated man driven by his beliefs incidentally in real life duvall was just as driven in getting the project underway since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost years before duvall was able to get it done paying for its production with his own money about five million dollars in terms of hardhitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film similarly those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thoughtprovoking experience on the other hand the apostles main strength duvalls preaching is also what limits the apostles target audience in terms of plot and pure entertainment value the apostle is definitely not for everyone teenagers action fans comedy fans and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church in other words the apostle is a four star performance but with a very limited audience ',?

'every once in a while a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise i dont necessarily mean in terms of quality rather im referring to the mere knowledge of its existence usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo it has slipped rather quietly into limited release and appears destined to slip out just as quietly thats a shame because princess caraboo is a delightful fable romantic gentle and very appealing whats more its surprisingly insightful and provides a sharpwitted lesson in english social history princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early th century england involving a young woman phoebe cates who is found wandering the countryside apparently unable to speak any english she is taken in by goodhearted gentlewoman mrs worrall wendy hughes her banker husband jim broadbent is nonetoopleased about this strange houseguest until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island the princess caraboo this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr worrall and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs worrall however local journalist john gutch stephen rea is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo as a social satire and comedy of manners princess caraboo is a winner it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr worrall a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude he is worse than one of the idle rich he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower they think nothing of simply eliminating them and since the house and money are all from mrs worrall he is a bit too close to them for comfort while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule director and cowriter michael austin keeps the treatment too lighthearted to be heavyhanded he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper as the princess becomes a sensation at court in one of the films best sequences princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in sensations an idea that takes on a timeless quality and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show social commentary aside princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment the performers are mostly delightful particularly phoebe cates who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime her supporting players are also appealing wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs worrall kevin kline as frixos the worralls suspicious and superior greek butler stephen rea as the worldweary but ultimately romantic gutch only john lithgow is a disappointment turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princesss identity the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt without becoming gimmicky it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isnt given more time to develop because the potential seemed to be there when it finally does blossom it seems too quick to be plausible princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp still it has both escapist and intellectual appeal and is well worth seeking out it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewardinga hidden gem ',?

'one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made seen is just a few steps away from brilliance however those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss the film received mixed reviews upon release but theres an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing but the script and the ultimate payoff are excellent the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable this piece of work is intensity its uncomfortable to watch yet compelling i want not to look yet i cannot turn away the story creeps along slowly and deliberately crafted by visionary director david fincher he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions but not giving away too much too soon this is the guy who directed the ominous alien seen is even more ominous because the threat is real its human and while the script takes some artistic licence the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic that is if a human being could be so intelligent patient wealthy and disillusioned after the most bizarre opening credits ive ever seen refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment the initial character development takes place morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society brad pitt costars as detective david mills the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys these two fine actors give the film its human qualities along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow who plays tracy mills wife however none of them stands out above the material no disrespect intended but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same an ironic note is that somerset has only a week or thats seven days left on the force to train his young protege the title of the picture also refers to the deadly sins as chronicled by john milton in paradise lost gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath incidentally i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found its the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking but i wont give that away as i said this has a great ending and no one should spoil it anyway the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the sinners suffer for it the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man they learn that he was murderedforced to eat himself to death the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and of course somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way if they didnt it would be one short movie the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story we see a lot of blood but its not especially violent the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shownlike most of the violence in pulp fiction seen is gory graphic and disturbing but all the gore is postdeath still if you tend to get queasy dont eat food during this film kevin spacey plays john doe the avenging angel who claims that hes the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings like many crazy men he has some fine ideas but some sick ways of expressing himself spacey doesnt appear until the final minutes and also doesnt receive billing in the opening credits however its his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not this character is so well written that its hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone no serial killer has ever been so creative seen is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and its often a little too depressing what it lacks in those areas it makes up for with believable dialogue topnotch screenwriting unexpected twists and realistic characters the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive fincher uses lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the film fortunately we dont find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits which are run backwards up the screen its better to imagine what paths they will follow this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget its got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thingthe evils of the world arent going to cure themselves seen raises some tough questions and its intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves useless triviacostars in s seen brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the best supporting actor oscarpitt in monkeys spacey in the usual suspects for which he won ',?
'youve got to love disney no matter what they serve up it is a guaranteed success as long as its animated kids have to go see the movie then they have to get the toys oh the video came out got to buy it or risk little billys temper tantrums for the next month all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca a visit to the magic kingdom stay at the disneyland hotel buy a disney tshirt eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick its both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it dale carnegie should have had it so good whats most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality you see disney animated features these days have two components theme and plot the theme changes with each new movie the plot does not the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same however while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as boxoffice receipts merchandising dollars and glimmers in the eyes of little children critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer luckily disneys latest animated offering mulan manages to be engaging and refreshing even while rife with formula the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns led by the imposing shanyu miguel ferrer soon chinas emperor pat morita mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in chinas defense when the fa family is served notice it is the elderly father fa zhou soontek oh who must answer the call as there are no other males in the household fearing her father will surely be killed in battle fa mulan mingna wen disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army mulan based on a chinese epic poem is a tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional womans role and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband we see that grace is not one of her strong points very early on we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to ones family and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker mulan fails at that task by leaving home to fight in her fathers place she may not only spare his life but bring honor too as is the case with most disney musicals the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film im not sure if they will get much airplay but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time both lea salonga who provides the singing voice for mulan and donny osmond who sings for shang the captain of mulans army unit and obligatory love interest are more than competent although salongas voice translates much better to animation you have to hear it to understand interestingly the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan there is no significantly big number which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie it is however an expectation which has been built by disneys own formulaic history and some viewers may feel as if something is missing artistically the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works it helps to contribute a more authentic and therefore more credible nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically disneyfied ethnic tale there are also a couple of visually standout scenes one involving the charge of shanyus hun army which utilizes the same computerenhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it when mulan resolves to take her fathers place she dons her fathers old battle armor and unsheathes a sword as she does so you can see her reflection in the polished metal it just left me thinking that was really cool a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film varying from the straight such as soontek oh as fa zhou to the comical such as harvey fierstein as yao a gruff pugilistic member of shangs conscripted army even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance i found the choice of b d wong as shang a little strange you may remember him as martin shorts wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast so i guess anythings possible in any event wong performs admirably as well one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people june foray who supplies grandmother fas speaking voice is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale as in boris and natasha marni nixon who provides grandmother fas singing voice is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i maria in west side story and eliza in my fair lady with this in mind hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films in an effort to be culturally sensitive and to avoid a miss saigon type debacle disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asianamerican actors for both lead and supporting roles in addition to the actors already mentioned the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong gedde watanabe james shigeta and george takei i guess clyde kusatsu wasnt available at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and happily adults this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next rather than hope that the next one is better ',?
'the story of us a rob reiner film is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films well has two of them the other being the instant about a very dysfunctional family american beauty the story of us a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family is a well written heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience including myself cry the story of us tells the story of ben bruce willis and katie michelle pfeiffer jordan and asks the question can a marriage survive years of marriage the film is about two individuals who have come together spent a good chunk of their lives together and shows when our main characters are him and her during the bad times and when they are us during the good times the story of us is about their entire years of marriage that is collapsing day by day ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they dont want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer or at least say they dont love each other anymore ben a cartoonist and katie a crossword puzzle writer have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage as they have grown to follow different views on life family and marriage katie is the more organized sophisticated type who wants to plan everything out while ben is a spontaneous adventurous individual who doesnt mind doing things differently than they were planned the story of us plays out nicely as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist told to the viewer through flashbacks as the film progresses it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage this method is highly effective as we see the characters changing from year to year slowly growing apart through the flashbacks we get to see the story of them through both of the characters eyes and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like as the story of us has three dimensional believable main characters the screenplay written by jessie nelson stepmom and alan zweibel dragnet is a touching down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer much like another one of nelsons films stepmom the script has an open honesty and outlook on life one that is so realistic you feel uncomfortable at many times because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar as most families these days most go through the hard times as ben and katie must if it wasnt for the first minutes that the writers wrote which are rugged and certainly flawed the story of us would have been this years best picture bruce willis a usual actionadventure star has certainly turned himself around in the past year he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies to a distinguished sophisticated actor as in last summers the sixth sense and now in the story of us willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script although i wouldnt pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan willis handles himself nicely and shines in a few of the films most powerful scenes enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season where to start about michelle pfeiffer pfeiffers performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion you wonder how how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism pfeiffers performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring will be in the hearts of any viewer that has watched this moving film the story of us is one of s most real yet funny films as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked superb acting direction writing story and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman make the story of us a touching unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall the films major high points are the fights between ben and katie as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed and although they also say things like its over or i hate you you can tell the two still share a deep connection and that inside somewhere they are still an us the bottom line a wonderful enchanting and heartbreaking film one of the most realistic heartbreaking films in recent years ',?
'truman trueman burbank is the perfect name for jim carreys character in this film president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide in spite of or was it because of his stature truman also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans and burbank california brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc if hollywood is the center of the film world burbank is or was the center of tvs world the world where our protagonist lives combine all these names and concepts into truman burbank and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world truman leads the perfect life his town his car and his wife are picture perfect his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light the next day during the drive to work the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian when the radio comes back to normal the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully his suspicion aroused he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door made to look like the back of an elevator into place two security guards grab him and throw him out truman is really suspicious now it gets even worse the next day when his wife a nurse describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge its best not to think about it she says trying vainly to change trumans memory truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world you know by now that trumans life is the subject of a television program his actions are real but everything else is carefully scripted from the death of his father to the choice of his wife truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is meanwhile christof the allseeing creator of trumans world does his best to keep him unaware and happy its sort of like westworld told from the robots point of view or jurassic park from the dinosaurs point of view we root for the captive of the cageworld our protagonist is counting on chaos theory to help him escape his elaborate trap the story written by andrew niccol writerdirector of gattaca introduces some interesting questions such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake although these questions came to mind i dont think the film itself asked them it certainly didnt address them or try to answer them i was particularly disappointed that the film didnt deal more with the trauma of learning ones life is a tv show carreys performance at the end showed a smidgen of trumans pain but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the films pacing earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well the two seemed exclusive of one another but weir and niccol didnt see it that way perhaps its not fair to criticize a movie for what it isnt but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here but on its own terms the movie is well made sight sound and pacing are all handled competently much of the first part of the movie is the truman show the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen the music is wellchosen and scored the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music when trumans world is still beautiful and perfect when the movie ends the score sounds more like a frantic driven tangerine dream opus while still keeping the same timbre philip glass epic music from powaqqatsi permeates trumans scenes of suspicion and awakening glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show and the pacing of the story was brisk there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just a few quick title cards a few interviews and then right into the show and the movie one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling there was no token scene of trumans idyllic life before it falls apart because it wasnt necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner theres also no point in the movie where the plot slows down its a quick straight shot to the movies end in terms of overall quality i would compare the truman show to niccols gattaca both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas neither film clicked and became an instant nevertheless i look forward to niccols next film whatever it may be ',?
'usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock others will mention meg ryan but for me its not even close janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now and its a good thing shes starring in the matchmaker because without her presence the movie would be bland unfunny and dull garofalo stars as marcy tizard a top aide to boston senator john mcglory who is suffering in the polls in an attempt to capture the irish vote he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglorys that never moved to america unfortunately for marcy her visit coincides with the towns annual matchmaking festival things get off to a rocky start for marcy though she has no hotel reservations for no rational reason and the tiny confined room tired old cliche she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub his name is sean and marcy finds him repugnant at first so you can obviously tell where this is headed the movie runs into a few roadblocks for instance the story is very thin none of the characters except the old local matchmaker are nearly as interesting as garofalo some of the characters like the political aide played by denis leary have wandered in from a completely different movie i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery and several closeups of garofalos winning smile the strange thing is that it works garofalos charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories and it carries this one ',?
'at first glance it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of year olds thats true of home alone and id bet money that its true of home alone opening soon but home alone actually has a lot going for it and the cartoon slapstick doesnt get in the way the mcalisters all of them are going to france for the holidays four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse the littlest kid kevin is the victim of the older kids cruelty kevins patience runs out when he learns that his plaincheese pizza has already been eaten and hes going to have to starve he attacks his big bully brother buzz who had been teasing him the fight disrupts the alreadychaotic dinner spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table a few cousins and an uncle the kneejerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased but they all point their fingers when he fights back the ultimate punishment comes from mom catherine ohara who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night on his way up the stairs he tells her that families suck and that he hopes never to see any of his family again that night the power goes out knocking out the alarm clocks so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport in a surprisingly plausible setup kevin is mistakenly accounted for and the family heads off without him its interesting that in a subtle way his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling and second they put all the kids in coach while they fly first theyre twothirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child meanwhile kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true hes finally rid of his family life is a dream come true he can jump on the beds watch rrated movies eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips and dig through his big brothers secret box slowly the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane he grooms himself he does the laundry he goes shopping i bought some milk eggs and fabric softener he also starts to miss his family not just for their company but for the security they bring the furnace in the basement is a scary monster the old man next door is a snowshovel murderer and two crooks are trying to break into his house macaulay culkin is cute but he isnt much of an actor still we can see that kevins character grows thanks to some good direction and editing for example acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night just as santa is getting in his car kevin asks the man to pass on his request he wants his family back to the real santa he learned how to deal with the furnace you turn on the lights and its not so scary anymore he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snowshovel murderer who actually turns out to be a nice man they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid finally in the last minutes kevin confronts his last fear the bandits head on literally this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick and after the movies genuine dramatic setup it is dessert its a lot of fun and it doesnt overwhelm the rest of the movie on the whole home alone is a great holiday movie john williams original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings but it does have its flaws the smallest problem is that culkin doesnt act very well as i said before he is cute but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkins insight into his character the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda the villains threaten kevins life about five times instead of im gonna get that kid they say im gonna kill that kid some might argue that the tone is the same but i strongly disagree mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic fauxpas ill probably never see home alone and i wish i had skipped home alone but i do enjoy home alone almost every year dont let your impressions of the others detract from the original which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick ',?

'if youre the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland youre going to love the hunt for red october youll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics or if youre a sean connery or alec baldwin fan or if you admired director john mctiernans earlier films die hard and predator in fact the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them the hunt for red october is an epic thriller adapted from tom clancys best selling novel set in an era before glasnost the movie revolves around a topsecret soviet submarine called the red october the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius played by sean connery ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine but he has other ideas he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean is he planning to start world war iii cia analyst jack ryan doesnt think so hes convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u s ryan played by alec baldwin is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin but the performances thankfully are rock solid baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connerys somber first officer its ironic to see neil and connery playing russians since they are both best known for their roles as british agents connery as james bond and neil as reilly ace of spies the large cast also includes scott glenn james earl jones tim curry and joss ackland plus richard jordan as the smooth u s national security adviser the special effects are remarkable but more than anything the hunt for red october is distinguished by its watertight plot screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment the movie doesnt get as sweaty or breathless as die hard because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with nonstop action the finale is rousing and suspenseful but essentially the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler ',?
'kevin smith is like a big kid his humor is that of a sophisticated juveniles he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books having also written a few he also has a cult following mostly composed of teenagers college students and smiths own fellow adolescentminded grownups smith is hilarious in person and in writing but when he tries to be earnest and moralize that is when he goes wrong kevin smith is a better writer than director and hell be the first to tell you that that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavyhanded great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them this was true in the overrated chasing amy and it is true for dogma as well that is not to say smiths message is a bad one in dogma smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and gods desires is superior to anyone elses basically dogmatism is bad changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight they also know what is best for you whether you like it or not this is not exactly a new message in movies see inherit the wind but i have no problems with recycling old ones particularly since dogmas protesters are proving smiths point smiths own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book but this is smiths personality and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible or koran etc correctly or if there even is a correctly and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany linda fiorentino being chosen by voice of god metatron alan rickman to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels bartleby ben affleck and angel of death loki matt damon along the way forgotten thirteenth apostle rufus chris rock stripper muse serendipity salma hayek and slacker duo jay and silent bob jason mewes and kevin smith himself come to bethanys aid fallen muse azrael jason lee proves to be the behindthescenes manipulator for all the chicanery the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smiths points and in itself has little dramatic momentum among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman jesus was black and the bible was written by a bunch of racist misogynistic white men of course kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes smith thought it might give validation to protesters claims that the film was sacrilegious but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke the films humor is uneven some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burningbush kind of entrance but many of the films jokes just bomb as in virtually anything involving salma hayeks serendipity also some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away still smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace among the actors fiorentino and rickman stand out by far fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight damon and affleck are fairly lackluster rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob who recur in all of smiths movies are much more in line with smiths brand of humor bud cort george carlin janeane garofalo guinevere turner and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances ',?

'i was born in which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons tracks and disco however since i was years old ive seen more than my share of adult films i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that im not against pornogrpahy ive seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available director paul thomas andersons boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema the mid to late s this was the period when xrated movies were real movies shot on film shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films films that attempted to tell a real story one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how like in an any other billion dollar industry the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete in this case the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette burt reynolds manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur known as jack horner horners has a steady family of performers some of whom live in his plush l a home but in the world of porn performers are a commodity the fresher the better when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque he decides to add him to his stable it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his as directed by anderson the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l a s hardcore film scene but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut by the films final image what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams boogie nights is not about sex it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers in fact the film isnt really about pornography at all pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own subculture to find acceptance of who they are the film goes to brilliant often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world yet like in the lauded tarantino films these people still have their own moral code their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion first stop the den mother julianne moore in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son second stop the cuckold crewman william h macy who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone the wife is played in hilarious cameos by reallife porn star nina hartley but the driving force behind the plot is year old eddie adams eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it with no real ambition of his own he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame his alcoholic mother clearly dissatisfied with her own lot abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house horner introduces him to amber waves moore who immediately adopts him a nuclear family is born the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her babies provides some of the films most poignant scenes clearly she is not even fit to manage her own life let alone nurture these lost children but the need to love and be loved is so strong they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family then again perhaps its not so different from real families at all eddie adams who later takes on the screen name dirk diggler is skillfully acted by former popstar mark wahlberg i say former pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job this is bold and brave territory for such a young man he pulls it off marvelously wahlberg is a big bright star with a big bright future boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt without the first amendment preachiness its intimate studies of character make it the superior film wahlbergs surprising performance is on par with woody harrelsons but in my opinion boogie nights is not the best film of the year i got the feeling that itus hour running time could have been cut by or minutes without losing any of its resonance still if the subject matter of this film intimidates you thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway ya know kinda like disco ',?
'james l brooks one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news returns to the big screen with this entertaining if slightly flawed comedy nicholson plays melvin udall probably the most horrible person ever on the screen hes racist homophobic and never has a good word to say to anyone so nobody talks to him except waitress carol conelly t v sitcom star hunt who was last seen in twister naturally udall conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop kinnear who nicholson hates all hit it off in the end like good will hunting and titanic even though the outcome is completely obvious as good as it gets is an enjoyable funny and warm comedy nicholson is hilarious as melvin churning out insults with superb relish only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers hunt is also good as waitress carol and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson theres also thankfully a bit of chemistry between them kinnear as the gay neighbor seems to have a slightly underwritten role hes more of a plot convience than a character although his performance is good his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together in fact the scene stealer is simons dog who is funnier than nicholson but then again pets are always cute on screen providing solid support is cuba gooding jnr jerry maguire and yeardly smith who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons although gooding isnt as good as is character in maguire he is still fun he overacts a little but not so much as to be annoying smith is also good although she has a fairly small role even director lawrence kasdan body heat makes an appearance as a doctor but this is primarily nicholsons film and every scene hes in hes steals it hes character is so hateful though its amazing that anyone talks to him at all especially carol and this is the films main problem its totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin she doesnt fall in love with him naturally the film forces her to fall in love with him also melvins character seems to go too nice too quickly i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice loving person it would take a helluva long time much longer than this film would like to make out brooks direction is good though if a bit average but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones he tends to pile on to much schmaltz but generally hes good theres also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer but generally as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie the movie is a bit overlong but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly overall as good as it gets is a fun movie even though it may be unbelivable and certainly worth seeing if just for jack nicholsons performance not quite as good as it gets pardon the bad joke but still good fun ',?
'dark city is such a rare treat it s a stunning hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london to boot it is accompanied by an intense well written and thoughtful story movies of this caliber and idea aren t made too often and it s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it alex proyas who s previous film the crow looked good but couldn t cover up the terrible acting or story here shows a near masterpiece a combination of metropolis edward hopper and phillip marlowe fused seemlessly at times it moves beyond film into artwork it is the story of strangers aliens from another planet and we know they re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats one of the detractions of the film who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live what makes up our soul these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ultimate technology of shaping matter with their mind called tuning they are aided by a human scientist played by kiefer sutherland who has betrayed his kind and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight during this time john murdoch played swiftly by rufus sewell wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light a terrific visual effect not only is murdoch confused but so is the audience without a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer he receives a phone call to flee as the strangers are after him i don t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop in a way regaining murdoch s identity along with him it s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography murdoch s wife anna is introduced through a stunning beam of light she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight shadows outlines of men in hats watch as she gently curves through the shine we see the outline of her body from behind an hourglass as she sings a slow rhythmic song a great entrance however a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied the city is nice to look at but if it s a poor story then it s not worth watching blade runner was popular not only because it s visuals but it s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience it is discussed it and argued therefore a success other science fiction films of recent times such as the fifth element are nice to look at but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy we re left with love conquers all after finishing the fifth element dark city is not so easily explained away as the strangers discovered locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task where is reality dark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the s and ranks along with the best made in the s such as blade runner and the two aliens films perhaps it s the best of the both decades it had the darkness of the aliens films as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner but moved beyond i think because the themes behind it were much stronger anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write i d love to hear it ',?

'in the opening shot of midnight cowboy we see a closeup of a blank movie screen at a drivein we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses hooves without an image projected onto the screen the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our minds eye even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema but do cowboys really exist or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper exploring this theme director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream like image of the cowboy is merely a myth as joe buck migrates from place to place he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself only further degeneration during the opening credits joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads john wayne the alamo as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show a lady on the air describes her ideal man as gary cooper but hes dead a troubled expression comes across joes face as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody joes persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream he romanticizes about making it in the big city but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance by the end of midnight cowboy joe buck loses everything and gains nothing just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success but how realistic are these ideals joe had raped and been raped in texas the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation the ability to pack up ones belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joes abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny we understand that joe adopts the fa ade of a cowboy a symbol of virility and gallantry as an attempt to neutralize his shame he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joes encounter with the gay student joe buck spills ketchup on himself standing up we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joes virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals signifying emasculation beyond the symbol of castration the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgins first sexual encounter a reference to joes first homosexual liaison the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joes emasculation it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients but effortlessly attracts men joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and faggot stuff there are two predominant images of new york the first is that new york is the rich cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty the other new york is travis bickles new york a seedy corruptive hell on earth joe envisions new york as the former but is presented with the latter mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions the people steal joes money the landlord confiscates his luggage and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity what has become of joes american dream schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food drugs and sex at the party all of joe and ratzos desires are made flesh joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami contrasting joes daily struggles shots of warhols crew display wanton indulgence there is an irreverence in the partygoers attitude we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular orgies breaking out in the periphery and drugs passed around like party favors the party makes a mockery of joe s ideals joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joes toils the american dream schlesinger suggests is merely a proletarian fantasy for those who are content no longer dream but become indolent as joe heads to miami all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished for joe nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately he surrenders the identity tossing his boots into the garbage he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus more introspective taking only a few glances outside the window instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus window with joe hardly taking notice the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before the world seems smaller to joe now the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock with perseverance can make a fortune in the big city joes attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york during his search for an intangible paradise joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream joe bucks progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons ',?

to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films but never took the directors helm nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more tarantino returns with a film he can call his own the film opens up with an homage to the graduate with jackie brown pam grier on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi samuel l jackson who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico however while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u s for ordell jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus michael bowen and atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton who catch her not only with the money but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs jackie didnt know they were in the package with the cash but thats of no consequence to the authorities who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted of course dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish ordell ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry robert forster to get jackie out of jail but while max is immediately attracted to her jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police sure enough ordell shows up at jackies apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good but she borrows maxs pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistols chamber to ordells head jackie proposes a deal since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more but this time for a more substantial fee fifteen percent of ordells half million dollars with a gun in his face how can ordell not agree by itself this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film however we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell but shes also making a deal with the feds as well as with max the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around instead its actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of todays movies at least this film has a little imagination most of the performances in jackie brown are above par pam grier of whom i had never taken notice before plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable samuel l jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy trying to do his best never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guys apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course hes just so downtoearth the nature of his job really doesnt occur to us even when were shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison or when we see the tools of his trade in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara a recently paroled friend of ordells and bridget fonda as melanie one of the girls ordell keeps around town unfortunately de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between and then they are mostly clipped sentences in this film hes not really de niro but stereotypical de niro uttering things like little bit and pretty much fonda on the other hand plays the slightly spacedout melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness such that even when she is annoying louis we are taking her side as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand the dialog is quick and snappy it grabs our attention and is actually interesting and in many respects this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves dont count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera however theres a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange and hes not really sure whats happening but by composing the scene just so his realization of whats going on is felt simultaneously by the audience we look at the screen and think gee thats clever and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on although tarantino isnt afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film there are shots where a character is simply driving and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head this is a tribute to both direction and acting however there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall and she is looking for something desperately looking for something we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what shes looking for but instead hoping shell just stop overall viewing jackie brown is time spent well some flap has already been made about the language used in the film but its really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today in fact one might even be able to say that the way in which these offensive words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness go see the film and see what i mean ',?
'for those of us who werent yet born when the s rock n rolled around monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies from otis redding to jimi hendrix janis joplin to the mamas and the papas and jefferson airplane to the who this documentary is jampacked with contagious energy but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves shot in at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time sure some have painted their faces and smoke joints but d a pennebaker the war room moon over broadway surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience no matter who is watching it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul the excitement starts before the music even begins a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer she replies that she feels lucky to do so there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers tries to get in touch with dionne warwick and when one band is tuning up a member remarks finally a decent sound system you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isnt about vanity its about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it a twoway street this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience its impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain and while the lyrics to wild thing may not be all that complicated watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love even if you dont recognize every band you see on stage you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats the only drawback to the film is the ending which unfortunately i must reveal all the other bands big names then and still today got approximately to minutes of screen time in contrast the last band on camera a wholly forgettable one gets an entire minutes of screen time for a film thats only minutes long thats too large of a chunk especially when previous acts are much more stimulating all in all monterey pop is a precious rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us the variety of music as well as the beautifully shot performances are easy to become immersed in if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular this is quickly dispelled its almost depressing to think that music this moving doesnt get made much anymore instead were stuck with nsync the backstreet boys and jennifer lopez all of whom should have stuck with modeling ',?
'this is a film about secrets some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl frances boyd ashley others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple geoffrey gaines stephen ramsey the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field and his artist wife lillian miriam healylouie who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work and still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line receiving a summer grant to study chemoelectric therapy geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together as their threeyear marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab which is off limits to her as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses his main argument is that this is what the public wants they dont want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments they just want the benefits of science that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster much like frankenstein was created is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science science as a business as opposed to the good science science that cares about the small farmer which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman alex vine david a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming methods that have just come about in the last thirty years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins the third view in all this is the artists represented by lillian who points out that the artists work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly why shouldnt the same be true of the scientist she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public questioning what is good or evil in society something that bad science has completely ignored geoffrey impatient to get ahead with his research feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on as he contacts one of the companys higher ups to argue his case but decides he cant wait any longer for their help so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester the gorgeous pet dog of frances a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car he is spotted by alex and one of his coworkers and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife afraid that alex will spot what he is doing as he rushes away from the area in the dinner scene that was unfortunately flatly done but was nevertheless the heart of the film as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything the scientists engage in a rational argument highlighting their different points of view while lillian reacts in an emotional way siding mostly with davids view but coming at it from a much different angle it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies that the directors point of view is absolutely right is beside the point the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became onedimensional characters geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster alex vine was likened to his last name the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art the inspiration for goodness and beauty alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alexs apartment geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it and mercifully the dog dies the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage but she also fails to respond to davids loving gesture for her to stay with him instead opting to head back to the city the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientists lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higherups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way what is progress what can one expect out of life is the small farmer about to become extinct the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions leaving no room for deeper arguments is the shame of this decent and smart film that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me as i dont like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit that inspite of its shortcomings it was worth seeing because of its visual statements though they were also not too subtle they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picassos guernica had for him both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on the pain that lillian feels as she forgets about her desires to raise a family and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song make the world go away blares out from the background after she has learned that frances beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband all in the name of science had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science perhaps the most pertinent question the film asks requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business as the question becomes can science be happily married with art ',?
'blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywoods premier leading men blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well although at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie the ideas behind blade are good as is the basic plot of the story but at times things seem to get a bit muddled and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once that really doesnt take away from the story too much but it does hurt it a little bit blade snipes is half man half vampire his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the traits of a vampire including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother but this isnt as easy as it seems because the vampires in blades world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires where do vampires get money well in blade they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea and a great addition to the movie blade runs up against the evil deacon frost stephen dorff a maverick in the vampire community he isnt content to live among humans and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an allpowerful vampire rendering him virtually unstoppable its up to blade to see that this doesnt transpire admittedly blade is style over substance through and through the story is a relatively forgettable one but it is fun none the less the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type this isnt a film that is going to win accolades for its performances and the actors know this the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise its a popcorn movie and no one involved has any illusions otherwise blades production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done although the mtvstyle cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle what blade excels at is bringing the lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life very cool ',?

'virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre since dark city films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix all the films released after it have been less successful david cronenbergs existenz released only a couple of months after the matrix was accepted and even appreciated by some but the hype was gone and when the thirteenth floor aired this fall it was completely overseen and ignored i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying feeling like eating the same meal over and over again it was therefore i was less than excited when i went out to see to the thirteenth floor however i was positively surprised by josef rusnaks latest picture matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality combining the best of hollywoods action and effects with an intelligent story existenz was a violent gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality ending in blood and madness the thirteenth floor is somewhere in between instead of going after the crowds the action audience like the matrix or aiming at the horror fans like existenz the thirteenth floor presents a more intelligent plot witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding in a near future on the thirteenth floor of a building a genius scientist hannon fuller has created a simulated world his personal dreamworld where every inhabitant is a complex selflearning program that only believes it is real right after the first testing of this world fuller is found murdered douglas hall his closest friend and business partner immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth a beautiful woman gretchen mol who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence the first download into simulation is impressive it is the creators first visit to his world his creation in order to enter this virtual universe you have to take over someones identity become another person this is called conciseness transfer and this is part of the tragedy in the film people wake up in unknown places and strange things start happen they start to doubt in their own sanity these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their users and creators with their sanity and their lives it is a frightening reality the fact that all the people in the simulation the program links are living out their lives oblivious not knowing that they are puppets in someones fantasy with an appealing blade runner type of detective story this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present our modern world is metal and glass cold unfriendly impersonal the thirties are different colorful beautiful elegant virile this contrast demonstrates a wish for change virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise to some a personal playground a life without any consequences for others a way to start over and correct their mistakes by living in an illusion of their past virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes dreams and fantasies to life at least thats how it is all beginning but when youre waking up from your dream the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise this almost narcotic effect soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised what is real what is thought who are we if these were answered this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made they are off course not answered but posed in an intelligent manner the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements since it portrays the contrast between these computersimulated universes kirk m petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour grace and color and setting this world in opposition to our own an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald kloses moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time a rather unusual thing aboutthe thirteenth floor is the almost complete lack of special effects there are no cgi animated creatures no bullets in slow motion this is a more philosophical approach reminding about the european way of filmmaking this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians but the more serious science fiction buffs and dark cityfans will be pleased this film is interesting and inspiring it has everything existenz doesnt but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix and then there is a happy end which like in dark city completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction including blade runner and dark city with this in mind the thirteenth floor doesnt make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now yet this is a beautiful elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality ',?

'in roger michells romantic comedy notting hill william thacker hugh grant leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends its name to the films title one day american movie superstar anna scott julia roberts walks in to purchase a book on turkey quickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an onagain offagain love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat the film opens with a nonverbal cue to annas stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actresss appearances in films and at premieres coming out of limousines walking the red carpets and such without words this sequence gives us a background to her character following however is a setup narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives i dont know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldnt have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film and which never resurfaces after the movies beginning but there it is if there were ever a clear case for less is more this would be it the film is told nearly first person from williams point of view as he is in every scene by nature of this arrangement we get a very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality wins us over easily in fact much of notting hills strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that hes even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honeysoaked apricots from his refrigerator or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image william assures her he wouldnt say a word then adds well ill probably tell myself now and then but id never believe it great stuff the downside to spending so much time with william is that we dont get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible were constantly exposed to williams thoughts feelings actions and desires but dont actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that were not sure what shes been thinking all the times in between this combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two makes this hugh grants film hands down he gets the great scenes look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great lines and gives an overall wonderful performance julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actresss top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in a time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her characters unpredictable behavior anna doesnt get a lot of our compassion this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast most notable is rhys ifans as spike williams eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh hugh bonneville emma chambers james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard as williams friends and family particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sisters birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst its a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation roger michells use of visuals doesnt sweep us off our feet but does give us more than your typical movie of this type for example there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying eight months later michell presents us with more interesting cues such as williams walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air were generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a birds eye view of the ground below music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the films scenes and some of this might have been better toned down but in other areas it works to full effect its kind of a mixed bag but still fares better than many of todays lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate notting hills grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the alltime greatest film pairings but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it for a couple of hours you should expect to laugh more than cry and thats not so bad now is it ',?

'a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nationstate against another a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy the violence continues it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone even total innocents anywhere at anytime that gives the figure his label edward zwicks the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states youd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad and the u s responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack however unlike the reallife tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin ladens camp and manufacturing facility the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal in retaliation the terrorists bring the fight to the new world unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agentincharge anthony hubbard denzel washington who works out of the bureaus new york office at one federal plaza while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple he encounters cia agent elise kraft annette bening also trying to uncover information generally the fbi is charged with problems inside the u s while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory but as the two form a tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government the original tagline for patriot games was there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil however true it was pulled before the movies release because it sounded too much like a dare revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states the siege is almost an invitation in itself because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america admittedly the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive whos going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by twothirds but the basic premise is still valid i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic actionthriller fare of good guy gmen against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arabamerican population and that in an effort to find the terrorists the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself in fact about halfway through the film when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city the liberties of all americans are put at risk although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups throughout the film maintains a conflict between hubbard who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law and general devereaux bruce willis who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides it actually gets rather heady at times but its a credit to screenwriters zwick lawrence wright and menno meyjes that they dont underestimate the intelligence of the audience i dont know if its his tone or inflection or something else but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great this combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the midlevel authority figure makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character ive seen recently and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable its somewhat unfortunate that her characters fortitude is broken at a certain point but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a toughguy role always standing straight and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face however the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the films development notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad a lebanese immigrant the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society difficult to say the least shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwicks favorite actor he directed washington in glory and courage under fire james horner seems to be his favorite composer i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific scorewriter graeme revell seven films this year already over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabianthemed music and horners record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irishsounding at most revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole its nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films weve been getting throughout the year missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes for example its pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick unfortunately theres a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eyecatching in the middle of the city and against no real opposition zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than feet from friendly troops verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point the film also gets a little preachy toward the end focusing on the ability of different races to get along a noble gesture the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously these flaws are glaring but they dont detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history ',?
'i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex yes more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster for all teenagers its almost like a rite of passage and what we did was sometimes downright nasty sometimes funny and sometimes shocking and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer american pie is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year just how great are their hormones raging one of them notes after watching disneys the little mermaid that ariel is soooo hot the four schoolmates are kevin oz finch and jim kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend but doesnt want to have sex until the time is just right but what is the perfect time there is just no way to know and that frightens him oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages finch is the phobic hermit who doesnt stand a chance with any girl so he pays someone to start spreading rumors about his prowess suddenly girls are lining up to go out with him but among these friends it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student his inexperience comes shining through he has much to learn and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with moms apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking raunchy yet unbelievably funny the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its r rating there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that theres something about mary was gloriously ribald in fact at first this film received a sinful nc rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teenaccessible rating but i guess after seeing the noholdsbarred coarseness of south park this seems tame by comparison teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest but unlike many teen sex comedies there is a genuine intelligence at work here these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences they know what they want yet temper it with responsibility but almost always its impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster and its these episodes that make american pie such a carnal delight to watch ',?
'note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction the cinematic output from its creator quentin tarantino has been surprisingly low oh hes been busy doing the talk show circuit taking small roles in various films overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn making cameo appearances on television shows providing a vignette for the illfated anthology four rooms everything it seems except direct another featurelength film its been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr tarantinos new feature film jackie brown one of the most anticipated films of the year and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the s things arent going well for jackie brown pam grier shes years old stuck at a deadend job a year plus retirement benefits that arent worth a damn as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america and shes just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton and police officer mark dargus michael bowen smuggling from mexico for gunrunner ordell robbie samuel l jackson who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry robert forster the loquacious ordell based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny bonghitting surfer girl melanie bridget fonda and agreeable crony louis gara robert de niro hang out operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat and hes soon out to silence jackie brown meanwhile the authorities target is ordell and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a halfmillion dollars only through a series of clever twists turns and doublecrosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses although jackie brown marks mr tarantinos first produced screenplay adaptation based on the elmore leonard novel rum punch theres no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film while hes adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead characters now black in terms of ambiance the film harkens back to the s from the walltowall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage s productions the opening sequence featuring ms grier wordlessly striding through the lax funky music blaring away on the speakers is emblematic of films of that era the timeframe for the film is in fact but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro of course nothing in the film screams s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists backstabbing and deceptions deliciously unfold the strength of jackie brown is the quiet understated relationship developed between jackie and max when they kiss its perhaps the most tender scene of the year tenderness in a quentin tarantino film sure thereve been moments of sweetness in his prior films the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer or even in reservoir dogs where a deep unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters but for the most part mr tarantinos films are typified by manic energy unexpected outbursts of violence and clever often wordy banter these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown but whats new here is a different facet of his storytelling a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr tarantino as simply a helmer of slick hip crime dramas with fasttalking lowlifes and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent hes the real deal this new aspect of mr tarantinos storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character that of the worldweary sensitive and exceedinglyprofessional max cherry whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching mr forsters nuanced understated performance is the best in the film he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie we smile along with him much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitationera icon pam grier in the lead with the wags buzzing that mr tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travoltas thensagging career as it turns out ms grier is solid in the films title role although nothing here forces her to test her range i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection though shes been working steadily over the years often in directtovideo action flicks but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burtons mars attacks and larry cohens original gangstas where she first teamed up with mr forster of course its true that her role here was a godsend a meaty a part as this is rarity for any actress let alone one of her age and current status in the industry while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone it marks tremendous growth of mr tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding and whose characterizations have never been better and while the films narrative doesnt really warrant a running time of minutes its filled with such sumptuous riches ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining inconsequential conversations between the characters that there wasnt an unengaging moment with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt itll be interesting to see what he tries next ',?
'seen december at p m at the crossgates mall cinema guilderland ny theater with matt perreault and my sister jena for free matt paid using prepaid passes if theres ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non stop action the james bond films are it and if theres ever been a james bond film that not only proves this but does so by pushing it to the extreme tomorrow never dies is it opening sequences almost always make or break action films when done properly not only are they actually exciting but they foreshadow things to come this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie but with a sense of the selfaware enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in first theres a hightech slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly chinese waters theres definite tension as there seems to be an unknown but certainly hostile third party involved who is manipulating both sides when the scene ends in tragedy its clear theres some kind of powerful conspiracy going on and who else to call on for such a case but james bond the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond brosnon as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious bond is clearly and obviously depicted as an outandout hero he singlehandedly takes out a small army of terrorists and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the copilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for over using but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly its not about the payoff because its obvious bond will escape instead its the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it all the while creating for witty hysterical comedy it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore because of political correctness and just plain coppingout on behalf of the filmmakers even the term villain sounds passe what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come yet making him seem completely plausible jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant cunning elliot carver a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world that is through his massive media empire not through nuclear weapons through some interesting detective work bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news not only is that an original idea for a conflict but one which could carry over into reality surprisingly this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become the films hook is the action and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way the story works much like bond himself always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot somehow a chinese agent wai lin yeoh bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid but also works because of this not in spite of it the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story although tomorrow never dies is far from perfect it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue ',?

' jaws is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen the movie opens with blackness and only distant alienlike underwater sounds then it comes the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score dahdum from there director steven spielberg wastes no time taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaws has attacked it never relinquishes its grip perhaps what is most outstanding about jaws is how spielberg builds the movie he works it like a theatrical production with a first act and a second act unlike so many modern filmmakers he has a great deal of restraint and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act until then he merely suggests its presence with creepy subjective underwater shots and williams music hes building the tension bit by bit so when it comes time for the climax the sharks arrival is truly terrifying he doesnt let us get bored with the imagery the first act opens with police chief martin brody roy scheider a new york cop who has taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island a fictitious new england resort town where there hasnt been a murder or a gun fired in years the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton doesnt want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money brody is joined by matt hooper richard dreyfuss a young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark its a perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying when vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca to search for the shark the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted by it jaws is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror it is like ten movies all rolled into one and its no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it was unceremoniously dethroned in by star wars even today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcocks psycho and it never seems to age although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences including several mechanical sharks obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill the technical limitations faced by spielberg in may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects scheider dreyfuss and shaw were known actors at the time jaws was made but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman nevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing whats right and going against the entire town its your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him dreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz gives a surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers however most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movies captain ahab a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards bordering of parody shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism hes slightly deranged and shaws performance is almost a caricature however there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u s s indianapolis a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hairraising than anything spielberg put on screen shaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film of course we cant leave out the shark itself with its black eyes endless rows of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaurs great whites do exist they can be as large as the shark in jaws and they are a threat every one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark a bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into the shark in jaws was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angles many have forgotten but jaws was a sort of precursor to waterworld a movies who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb but as we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacles and delivered one of the finest primal scarethrillers ever to come out of hollywood ',?

'note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned milos formans first film since the illfated valmont columbias the people vs larry flynt is a vastly entertaining if not particularly enlightening biopic of hustler publisher and selfmade millionaire larry flynt who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late s and early s the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order we open with young and dirtpoor larry flynt and his brother jimmy peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky cut to forward in time where the two flynt brothers now young men are running the struggling hustler gogo clubs in cincinnati the strip clubs are in a dire financial state and in a lastditch effort to salvage the operations flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter this evolved into the adult periodical hustler magazine creating larry flynt a vast financial empire and the rest is history what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material and who railed and preached against him flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt and his driven singleminded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression regardless of personal cost the people vs larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynts true love althea leasure whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations considering the serious nature of the films theme the importance of the united states first amendment the people vs larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully lighthearted and humourous much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynts outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances some of his chosen apparel is hilarious and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity the films focus is on the flynts many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech but the heart of the people vs larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff harsh and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues but with althea we see his loving affectionate side theres a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking ultimately the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors but from the strength of flynt and altheas love for each other woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a careertopping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience and a very compelling protagonist for the film courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn completely raw and impulsive its a very solid performance brash and naturalistic and love is extremely compelling its difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen and her chemistry with harrelson is deadon edward norton as flynts straight levelheaded lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier costars in the people vs larry flynt much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film one can sense the frustration that nortons character feels when harrelsons freetalking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind and this results in a heightened emotional punch when nortons isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges milos forman keeps the film moving although it runs over two hours it never drags and his direction of the film is very effective eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic theres also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot which is both clever and extremely entertaining two minor quibbles with the film it certainly seems like the people vs larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech consequently the first thirty minutes of the film introducing and setting up the characters seem unduly rushed perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters the film clearly shows what flynt althea isaacman and rev jerry faldwell did and on a superficial level some of their motivations but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level for example why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton president carters sister to be bornagain is a mystery to me then again perhaps it was to him as well these two points dont detract greatly from the film the people vs larry flynt is certainly among the very best studioreleased films of and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression and as a touching love story ',?
'lake placid is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie ok so maybe it is but this one is enjoyable and clever actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film well the ending is kinda scary but in most horrorcomedies they are i will admit that lake placid isnt an oscar worthy film but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth after a man is bit in half she gets there but really doesnt understand why she is there bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man they go out and find what is going on what they find though isnt great a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid over years old he has migrated here for who knows why they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid and well youll have to see the movie to find out her character is very funny and foulmouthed which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad but funny to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws with the opening sequence and some others it is not original and is when you watch this movie you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it david e kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job the characters have smartmouths two foul and some great oneliners but believe me dont take lake placid too seriously or you wont like it but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun popcorn type movie but i guess it rates above the popcorn rating sit back watch the movie laugh scream and whatever you want even though the movie is r and i put violence and gore theres really not that much gore but what there is might seem kinda gross to some lake placid is a smart clever funny and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too ',?
'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the film noir genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control fargo millers crossing blood simple and offthewall comedies centered around an eccentric scatterbrained lead character raising arizona the hudsucker proxy their latest offering the big lebowski falls within the latter category though there are elements of the crimegonewrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film the main difference however is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didnt quite have the brains to get it all together the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy whos wise to the world but he doesnt really want to do much of anything besides go bowling smoke pot and generally relax that main character is jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges introduced by the films rambling narrator sam elliott as quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county the dude is unemployed needless to say and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends walter john goodman a borderlinepsychotic whos in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebodys cheating in a bowling match has the whole world gone crazy he shouts at a suspected cheater and donny steve buscemi whos always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it donny you have no frame of reference here these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana john turturro who when we first meet him is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of hotel california and if its possible seems to be even more of a head case than walter if that doesnt give you a good idea of this films absurdist tone then perhaps this will the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dudes rug theyve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the big lebowski david huddleston and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny tara reid owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ben gazzara the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug he doesnt have any luck but when bunny is apparently kidnapped the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the million ransom unfortunately walter gets involved and fouls up the dropoff and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers the dudes car gets stolen along with the briefcase containing the money soon the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german nihilists who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn meanwhile the big lebowskis daughter maude julianne moore a feminist avantgarde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked wants to recover the money for her family the plot however is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revivals run through the jungle and it fits the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble usually unsuccessfully the film doesnt feature quite as many oneliners and sight gags as the coens other comedies though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor particularly in the dudes dream sequences and acid flashbacks but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this jungle but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution theres also a noticeable but not too heavyhanded thread of social commentary in the big lebowski which incidentally takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin at the beginning we see george bush on television making his this aggression will not stand speech the coens take aim at just about every elite l a subculture in the book the egotistical wealthy businessman the bums will always lose shouts the big lebowski at one point the porn industry the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their peaceful beach community and so on by the end we really start to admire the dude who almost certainly harbors the least aggression of anyone in this story his passive resistance emphasis on passive albeit to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters he also turns out to have a pretty wellfunctioning brain in his head even if he doesnt like to use it very much his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when hes getting a run around and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness but they dont just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either i think that more than anything is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy it manages to approach characters like the dude and to some extent walter with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatterbrained audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the undynamic duo by the end of the movie given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first its good knowin hes out there the dude takin it easy posits the narrator towards the end i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken

'being the selfproclaimed professional film critic that i am i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia coming soon to dvd until only recently after all its considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai and doctor zhivago so one day a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it i was initially skeptical that something made almost years ago would be able to keep my attention for the buttnumbing hours of its duration but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against the winner of seven academy awards in for best picture director editing cinematography art direction music and sound after watching the film again i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t e lawrence during world war i lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence played by thenunknown actor peter otoole as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be reassigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i shot in panavisions famed super mm format the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic it is absolutely breathtaking using stunning cinematography costuming and direction shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in and watch this story unfold before my eyes every shot is choreographed as a portrait a living tribute to a great land david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time a far cry from its pathetic uncreative existence today after watching the film the first thing that came to my mind was ive got to do a remake of this film but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modernday movie executive okay its going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert we are going to need to blow up a fullsize train because computergenerated effects probably wont do it justice and we are not going to use any big stars and wont have any female actors since theres no love story yes my friends the velvet curtain fell on the goldenera of hollywood a long time ago but at least we still have the proof to show all wouldbe producers and directors out there just how good a film can be ',?

'i think that any competent member of the human race whos ever seen a movieany moviecould probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer even though i try very hard to not predict films as im watching them especially not romantic comedies the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds and sometimes minutes before i actually saw it happen on screen but i dont care not even a little my reasons for this are simple adam sandler is great drew barrymore is great the movie is so funny there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard i havent laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers sandler plays robby hart a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music in the opening scenes he seems like a happygolucky wedding singer at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual steve buscemi who decides that his brothers wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life up to that point was utter pointlessness a week later at his own wedding he is left standing at the altar by his exfianc e linda angela featherstone with his life in complete disarray he meets julia barrymore a waitress she is engaged to glenn matthew glave and is to marry him in about three months julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans soon and predictably it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk and that robby and julia really love each other oh sure its trite and if anyone making this film expected us to like feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer then they truly underestimated their audience what makes the story bearable aside from the terrific costumes and s music are the performances barrymore is simply adorable here ive never seen her look so close to the way she did in et not only is she pleasant to look at but her acting job here really is a good oneand it doesnt hurt that the character is likable and adequately wellwritten and the jerk played in fullforce by graves is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy ive ever seen naturally the true star here is sandler i think the guy is flatout hilarious he can say something that just isnt funny and his delivery makes me laugh his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can indeed hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler the wedding singer gives him a character that for the first time he actually has to fit into as far as im concerned he succeeded and this film is testimony that he does in fact have some range in his talents and the movie is just so funny perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc e abandoned him this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air and while the film like all romantic comedies takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half my formal complaints for the wedding singer arent very important the film is predicable but who cares the characters are extremely likable the movie is ridiculously funny and the experience is simply enjoyable in addition to this i cant imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film in that order i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review i just want everyone to know that i laughed a lot ',?
'theres good news and bad news about mulan the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavyhandedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules on the other hand the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast but mulan is a step in the right direction and disneys best animated feature since the lion king after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians mulan is set in feudal china and features the everpopular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married thats what we find out when young mulan voice of ming na wen screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her cartoons meanwhile word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns since mulans a girl that means her decrepit old father must go she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family thats chinese culture for you so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her fathers uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army it should have been called g i chang mulan calls on her ancestors for help they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up voiced by eddie murphy mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges murphys performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin lots of wisecracks and adlibs and even an introductory song about how much fun theyre going to have you aint never had a friend like mushu speaking of songs mulan doesnt have too many of them which is a plus with a story like this disney songs about war probably wouldnt go over too well heigh ho heigh ho its off to war i go and the ones they do have arent memorable the best of the bunch sad to say is be a man the requisite basic training montage song yes even in medieval china they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle sung by donnie osmond a bad sign if ever there was one be a man accompanies footage of mulans platoon going from screwups to heroes it makes me wonder has there ever been a musical montage in a movie thats ended badly i only wish reallife problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage for the curious mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulderlength talk macho and slap guys on the butt as was male custom a thousand years ago in china the deception fools everyone but the audience who thinks she might be able to pass for a yearold boy at best but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army led by a big evileyed attillalooking monster as a villain the head of the huns is menacing evil and entirely forgettable i saw the movie yesterday and i dont remember the mans name otherwise mulan is a good movie the animation of the characters themselves isnt as rich as it could and should be but there are some amazing battlefield shots eddie murphy pulls off some good oneliners as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita the quintessential asian movie star hell george mr sulu takei does a voice in mulan you get the sense disney said to themselves alright lets get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood who can you think of well theres mr myagi good and mr sulu perfect weve got ourselves a movie now soon disney really will be able to paint with all the colors of the wind ',?
'i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate cubas oscar nominee for best foreign film directed by tomas gutierrez alea who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo memories of underdevelopment i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema back in the late s it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition i knew then that memorias was probably a statesanctioned political missive and now expect strawberry will follow suit fellow internetters primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba soc culture cuba have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party lineit probably looks like political criticism but it aint so having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castros repressiveness i cant conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution and i cant imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement as kids say these days duh the revolutions current state needs no criticism its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident the proper questions to put relate to castros legitimacy i bet the film takes castros power for granted and that this or any other movie produced under cubas state control cannot question his right to run cubas political show ongoing now for more than years thats why i just cant believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime lets see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up i saw the filmtwice i was right castro remained intact strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young dialectic materialist as he describes himself and a homosexual photographer diego in cuba the young man david is the son of peasants a symbol of the revolutions reason for being grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education he studies political science instead of literature his avocation because he perceives it is his duty therein lies a likely unintended irony since cuba has no need for political theoreticians cubas government is castro diegos lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life he enjoys the finer thingstea opera art he does not do voluntary work for the revolution his small apartment is a sensual oasis the moniker bourgeois figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie however he is a revolucionario in his own way the supporting roles are filled by an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche davids roommate who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme davids exgirlfriend who dumped him for another guy yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband german a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit and who strikes a faustian pact with the government gutierrez alea and codirector juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too heck towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor he really loves the revolution as supposedly does everybody else in cuba and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws real criticism is missing though this movie is political window dressing luis aguilar leons op ed piece on fresa in the miami herald march at a did not color my judgment it presaged my intuition aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this films political angle best like many artistic manifestations in cuba strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment as art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point although terrible propaganda this is otherwise a fine film ',?
'steven spielbergs amistad which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who owned them is concerned with several different aspects of this story first the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery second it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins last and most importantly it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade amistad succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another antislavery movie having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery i doubted that there was much i didnt already know about it fortunately i turned out to be wrong for one thing spielbergs camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders operations in africa so amistad was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning and some of the images here are in fact much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery one scene in the middle in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their excess slaves by throwing them overboard to drown has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc rating the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time exposing politicians as narrowminded opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff of course but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time such that john quincy adams and probably other politicians like him who clearly disapproved of the practice was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court the biggest success of amistad is probably the characterization of cinque djimon hounsou who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin matthew mcconaughey the lawyer who represents them in court through cinque we are given a window into the native culture as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that again contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles what kind of country is this where laws almost work he asks baldwin in bewilderment when he learns that the case must be retried before the supreme court spielbergs direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinques angry outburst in the court room still there isnt enough of this for it to be a serious problem the main flaw in this film which prevents it from earning four stars is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni cant quite handle all of these issues at the same time so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie this summers contact for example dealt with several issues at once but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and most importantly all of them were resolved at once amistad tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams but it somehow feels a little forced and in any case the speech itself which lasts almost fifteen minutes wears out its welcome about halfway through perhaps the best way to describe it is this amistad is three four star films edited into one almost every individual scene works but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence and thus is less than the sum of its parts however i cant honestly say how it could have been done differently and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery ',?
'rated r for strong language sexual dialogue drug use crude humor violence and brief nudity starring ben affleck matt damon linda fiorentino salma hayek alan rickman chris rock kevin smith jason mewes jason lee george carlin alanis morissette running time minutes being a huge fan of kevin smith i was expecting a lot out of his newest project dogma it might just be kevins best work to date its very funny with smart and foulmouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isnt in a little movie premiered at sundance this little film was called clerks and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation you really cant meet a person on this green earth who has not seen clerks it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming in kevin made another movie mallrats that flopped horribly thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in chasing amy came out and was kevins biggest success to date now in we get a great little movie by the name of dogma wow what a cast ok here is the plot in this movie linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic one day at her house metatron the voice of god appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels matt damon and ben affleck from getting back into heaven by ways of a church ok now get this she is told to find two prophets one who talks a lot and one who doesnt however she gets jay and silent bob instead who give us great performances now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the th apostle falls out of the sky chris rock and helps guide her to find these angels salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way azrael jason lee who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win bethany linda fiorentino has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith what a movie it is everything rolled into one an offensive offbeat smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end and ends up being a feelgood movie who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie of course the best and funniest of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob probably the best characters in movies that i like the starstudded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while the script was written by kevin smith with many fwords in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isnt and makes us laugh at the same time as we think chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well with some lines linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay as well as silent bob alan rickman jason lee salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles being oscar winners for the good will hunting they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story the movies only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members dogma stands as a new and i think i can safely compare it to clerks while being funny at times in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but cant deny it dogma will offend people especially deeply religious people but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you all kevin smith fans must see ',?
'i know that funnest isnt a word fun is a noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective but thats the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run no wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ive ever seen so to hell with websters chicken run is one of the funnest movies ive seen in a while i cant remember the last time ive seen anything funner the chickens at tweedys farm are up to something living in a concentration camplike atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box one night a brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farms eggselling plan for a pieselling plan she orders a huge piemaking machine cackling chickens go in pies come out what sort of pies chicken pies of course codirector nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscarwinning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and a close shave the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures part of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and a close shave owed a great deal of inspiration to detective stories but in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived now teaming with codirector peter lord park has created a similar creature in chicken run the plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for a quick reference to the ballbouncing scene with some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement thing is the film doesnt feel like its been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done part of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisonersofwar movie starring chickens park and lord milk the incongruity for all its worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is but theyre chickens so its funny to us another thing that helps chicken run and most of parks films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films theyre cribbing there are references to the great escape obviously and stalag the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom theres even a nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in a little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and film history the braveheart reference is a hoot if you catch it when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution consider this since july of last year ive seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online out of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome why because once you got past the thought that theyre parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose they were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing conversely chicken run doesnt lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene if youve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun even if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before its understood and as a result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either enjoyment of this movie doesnt require knowledge of film history but if youve got it chicken run is that much richer the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that its hard not to fall in love with every one of them ginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it she has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gungho veneer the characters inevitable romance doesnt feel contrived but sweet poor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isnt any help jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs a hen that runs away with most of the best oneliners all while perpetually crocheting a sweater and two supplytrading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence they even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as a delightful surprise the film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens the animation is firstrate remember that this was all done the oldfashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail as in such topnotch family fare as a bugs life or toy story chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but a active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because theyll catch all the details anyway the movies just a boatload of fun funnest damn movie ive seen all year ',?
'seen at the st portland international film festival film title supermarket woman director juzo itami country japan cinematography yonezo maeda music toshiyuki honda cast nobuko miyamoto masahitko tsugawa shiro ito yuji miyake akiko matsumoto super features typical itami film funny and pointed in its own way if you dont care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket then this film is not for you maybe it is better to ignore it as this strong and biting satire as only juzo itami can deliver will give you an insight as to what some foods go through having in the past made films that pulled every punch imaginable from the family traditions the funeral to taxes a taxing woman a taxing woman returns to the diabolical gangsters minbo to hospitals the seriously ill juzo itami this time takes on the supermarkets own war to get the consumers and while this film has its funny side in the crazy situations that it creates it also shows another side which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer goro has a supermarket and a competitor comes into the neighborhood trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket bargains galore its name has in mind the closure of goros humbler venue so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can goro hires hanako a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management than they are in anything else hanako as she gets familiar with the operation discovers many of the tricks of the trade done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market and the procedures are not always fresh food but a new packaging and a new date to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves hanakos ideas take hold starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket being that they do not even shop there at all and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store a price error forces them to give away eggs for very low prices and causes the store a few hassles but it brought the people in and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things as the operation gets stronger the competition also has trickery up its sleeve and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors eventually these people are found out and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully until in the end they all have a showdown and here the truth and honesty win out and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent in the process they also find that freshness with some very funny jokes on this word as well becomes a much more important tool than they imagined with some very nice performances in this hectic and fast paced film this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much even though towards the end it is suggested but this would take away from the satire and its strengths with food gags all over the place the film lets you have it and what fun it is worth seeing editorial the director of this film juzo itami died shortly after the film was finished and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare and uncompromising we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making of which he must have had a few stories to tell but we will have to do with much of the japanese society and its many errant ways not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all should anyone have the guts to tackle it we could learn something along the way too worth seeing specially is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns the funeral is also good although not as funny as the later films tampopo is also very enjoyable all four of these films are available in video which means your best local site for foreign film may have them ask for it ',?
'do film critics have morals are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow naturally we dont want to go into a film with any preconceived notions which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish secondly and along the same line we cant prejudge a film because of its stars director etc the difference well in the first one wed go into a film thinking its going to be dumb or its going to be good and that would affect our viewing that movie sounds and looks dumb so im not expecting much on the second hand were simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal grudge against the film company its made by disney oh its just a merchandising ploy then the actors jim carreys in it its gonna stink or the director who cant be that good this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint make sense ok but what about comparing isnt that kind of along the same lines when we compare a certain actor or director or even composers credibility in one film to another they were involved in is that really fair sure in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more but what about jackie brown for example is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both i think it is and ill tell you why a good critic should be able to view the film from the average joe or jane viewpoint while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film sometimes that can be tough the acting was superb but i was bored or i loved it it was sooooo cheezy might be used to describe a film these are contradictions and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique but which is more important and which is better an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again getting back to the point my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because were reflecting what the public wants to know anyway every average person out there whos interested in this film is likely to ask how does it compare to pulp fiction and so as a critic im already responsible to ask that same question jackie brown stars pam grier the blaxploitation heroine from the s who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character tarantinos pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travoltas sudden revival in the movie industry and with talks of an oscar nomination the same is likely to happen for grier weve made it thru comparison jackie is a yearold airline stewardess who brings in extra cash and probably her main revenue by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie pulp fictions samuel l jackson and comparison ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara robert de niro a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half million dollars trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton and taken into custody for possession of narcotics as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed naturally this proves an obstacle to ordells plans and not as friendly intended as wed hope he posts jackies bail after she is put behind bars the thing is ordell is in this for no one more than himself and as we learn from his previous actions hes willing to kill anyone who stands in the way jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze ordell wont think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as shes always done yet at the same time a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided it comes down to a simple question would jackie rather face ordell or prison what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help the law ordell or maybe just herself coming into play is another s veteran robert forster as jackies bail bondsmen max cherry maxs obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance also involved is ordells surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda a ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role but theres nothing more to her and therefore she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself de niro is a brilliant actor but a character who hardly ever speaks doesnt need a de niro to play him compared to pulp fiction comparison the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable in pulp fiction even the small seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful complete and lifelike whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldnt have suffered much with a lesser talented cast the exception being grier tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth sadly grier too could have received a bit more attention especially when the story is all about her newlyjarred perception of life jackson teams up with tarantino again but the chemical reaction isnt as awesome as the first time jules was the rambling biblequoting hitman in pulp fiction and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off and although jackson is really really good in jackie brown i dont think hes quite as irreplaceable in fact maybe a new face would have been better jackson couldve remained tarantinos jules and a new guy could have become ordell forever to remain so in our memories sadly these characters are too much the same except ordell just isnt as impressive and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning this is griers film so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantinos quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonards novel rum punch for those moviegoers dont expect another pulp fiction and youll be satisfied for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of s film making the directing has toned down a bit however yet were still reminded that this is tarantinos movie thanks to odd splitscreen storytelling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints so getting back to the question that i began with this isnt pulp fiction at all its good but it isnt anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place this is a more conservative tarantino but not one that wont satiate true fans if you can realize that this isnt going to knock your socks off then youll be happy to at least let it massage your feet after all we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy ',?
'on rewatching italian writerdirector dario argentos much lauded murder mystery tenebrae i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his giallo murder mysteries while its certainly not perfect repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal anthony franciosa where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book tenebrae with the police on his back for leads he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa he brings grace charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding reallife horror around him the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral ambivalent shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business tenebrae is perhaps the most multilayered of argentos scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep redprofondo rosso the fulllength italian language version and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes needless to say for argento fans there is no denying the directors brilliance as a stylist many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria instead tenebraes set design and lighting paints a sleek clinical chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world and the soundtracks mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment so tenebrae has much to recommend it no question still constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative some critics argue that logic doesnt matter in argento films but damnit it matters in all films to the point where viewers dont deserve to feel cheated by the way if you dont want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which properly handled could have proved ingenious we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who we later discover is none other than the author peter neal he is insane apparently the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides its time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife he is finally revealed to us as this second killer in the films bloody climax but argento muffs the twist both technically and narratively you see we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killers house but thanks to poor editing its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway bad cutting puts the timing way out in other words hes almost in two places at once during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring by the films end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have selfinflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant the injury he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock thus the revelation of the hero as a killer and antihero in the final scenes may still prove shocking but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled helpfully in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along but there too is a problem as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least the story owes us a better understanding of franciosas mind his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies for instance a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike we would assume the rider is the same boy but it turns out to be some male character we arent even introduced too thats careless filmmaking pure and simple why you may ask do i go on about the storys flaws because when it comes to visuals and set pieces argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where almost unbelievably it jumps a high fence and chases her across town finally as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine she accidentally stumbles on the serial killers lair its an absolutely masterful sequence tense and exciting and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone and thats exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating too often it seems argentos films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts mind you if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look and if youre a fan of argentos unique style of giallo thriller then its essential see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli its a stylish greatlooking and quirky film despite the problem narrative a shame because it doesnt have to be that way take argentos more recent stendhal syndrome where with the aid of cowriter franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache proof that he can do it if he tries ',?

'there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actors effort often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile when one of these comes along i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders but sometimes there is simply no other explanation and such is the case with the hurricane this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin hurricane carter would normally be called norman jewisons the hurricane as per the tradition of referring to a film belonging to a director but though he does decent work jewison cannot claim ownership of the hurricane because there is one reason this film works at all and his name is denzel washington washington plays carter a boxer who in was convicted of a latenight shooting in a bar jailed for years he maintained that he had never committed the crimes but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter through the efforts of that group and carters lawyers he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted the film details carters childhood which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop dan hedaya when he finally got out of prison for good carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer seemingly having his career on track until the police framed him for multiple homicide despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities he remained imprisoned flash forward to when lesra vicellous reon shannon a young africanamerican boy living with a group of canadian tutors reads the book carter wrote while in prison the book entitled the sixteenth round opens young lesras eyes to the injustice that was carters life and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer lesra convinces his canadian friends deborah unger liev schreiber john hannah to work with him towards his goal the hurricane leans on denzel washington he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will and he does so brilliantly its probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin cartera fictional personality invented solely for the film the actors work is masterful washington throws himself into every moment refusing to keep the audience at arms length we feel everything he feels the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost washingtons is a performance of weight and emotional depth he doesnt merely play angry happy or sad he feels it at the deepest level his work is masterful and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor norman jewison directs the film doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection the hurricane moves quickly with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is and nothing is terribly confusing his boxing scenes constructed with clear inspiration from raging bull get inside the action very well and they are believable as real sports footage jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick carter is sent to solitary confinement for days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform and jewison assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell jewisons best achievement in the hurricane is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hardknock life and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again sadly though the films chief failures lie with the screenplay as with most of the goodbutnotgreat efforts to round the pike this winter there is much to interest a viewer in the hurricane but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich d route possible it does take a look at the supporting characters for example who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil carter and lesra played nicely by shannon who deserves credit are the only real people here everyone else is a stereotype the canadians are good the cops are bad the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their loveydovey commune and it is a commune despite the films failure to make that clear while every racist cop especially dan hedayas melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey hate put me in prison loves gonna bust me out and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a madefortv lifetime special its too bad the cast is game the director does his job and the subject matter is interesting but the script takes the safer slightly more boring route far too often i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than hes a racist pig i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice in short i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens criticism has been levied against the liberties the hurricane takes with the truth of what really happened to carter and much of it is deserved for example the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello only to be screwed by the judges who ruled giardello the winner most accounts of the fight however have carter losing fairly furthermore much of carters criminal past is conveniently left out of the film and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained of course the hurricane works mainly as a fable so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially but even dismissing such issues dont remove one fact the hurricane is a highly flawed film only one actor could have made a schmaltzy predictable picture like this work as well as it does and its a good thing the hurricane has that actor carter has been quoted as saying denzel washington is making me look good but hes not the only one washington makes this film look good denzel washingtons the hurricane sounds pretty good to me ',?

'i didnt realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa the motion picture association of america the folks who decide whats g nc pg r or x to ask why the preview was rated r so that we can make some sense of their response let me tell you about the movie itself the celluloid closet is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades its brilliant funny naughty and extremely poignant it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that as a rule gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen regardless of how veiled or how sordid the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if theyre not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be the movie itself is rated r and for good reason it contains scenes of bloody violent gay bashing and graphic uninhibited sex as with any movie i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend a date my year old niece alone or not at all but thats the movie now back to the preview prior to this film being theatrically released it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times there was no nudity no violence no bad language nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience okay whoopi goldberg did refer to someone boning someone but the last i knew that wasnt one of the seven words you cant say on tv except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing hmmmmm when i inquired about the rating on the trailer a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from the handbook that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone hello i was in the office and it was the middle of the day bravely i pursued ive seen that trailer oh probably half a dozen times i gulped and i dont remember that scene well she chirped its there our little eyes are trained to see that no really in the words of dave barry i am not making this up they are trained to see that when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her gosh i certainly dont mean to question the mpaa or the handbook i would however like to suggest that its they who are in the closet on this one and the light aint good in there but having seen the celluloid closet and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study email me and ill give you the details none of this was any big surprise the point of the movie was that homosexuality even in the politically correct s is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society a point well made in this candid and honest film now i could go off on the mpaas ruling that a trailer must contain no homosexuality or lesbianism and ask how that is defined particularly in light of some of the things both sexual and nonsexual that ive watched straight people do in trailers i just dont feel the need to go there because it seems so obvious ill instead suggest that the mpaa reevaluated their evaluation criteria let the ratings reflect not subject content like sex and violence let them reflect attitude content in the future id be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped then id truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time ',?
'no i did not read the novel by thomas hardy jude the obscure his final novel final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again see i did do some research on it about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life but after watching the movie i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is jude is a satirical film from start to finish about societys way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system but whats remarkable is how timeless this film is the film takes place in the late th century or early th wasnt really sure but its story could even be retold today in modern form although itd be kinda different a given it tells the story of jude christopher eccleston the psychotic accountant from shallow grave a simple dimwitted young man with big dreams in its bleak foreboding opening shot in grainy black and white he gets a lesson from phillotson liam cunningham his teacher as they stand upon a mountain looking upon a city in the distance he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella rachel griffiths because they frolicked in the hay literally but did not ultimately share anything in common he moves away to a town with a giant university with a chance to learn more and get ahead in life taking a welding job he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars reciting latin over and over again and training himself but when he sends his application for the school in he is bluntly told to just remain a worker another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there sue kate winslet his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job for none other than phillotson at the local school there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business nudge nudge several twists turn in the storyline and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business an interesting scene to say the least and are soon born into a controversial nonwedlock as she eventually gives birth to their baby and jude inherits his son from arabella who turns up again after awhile because they arent married and because theyre cousins they run into problems with every place they go to carrying around two children everywhere and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time then moving on if you didnt think this was harsh enough wait till you see what happens later on the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world he will never gain any true happiness and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life part of it is his fault hes too optimistic and too gullible but society has a way of taking these people and hurting them until their death the ending of jude is bleak because it has to be although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse guess ill have to read it now jude offers a satirical view on societys cruelties but shows no way of curing this and thank heavens it doesnt theres no way to relinquish the selfishness of society and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain peoples minds and thats what jude is sure its one hell of a downer but it needs to be the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads and some good supporting work along with it christopher eccleston slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression plays jude wonderfully sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face and making him kind of childlike at other times kate winslet in a pre titanic performance is brilliant nailing every psyche of her character and creating someone whos troubled but very seductive with her personality kate may be the best actress in her age group if you dont believe me see titanic branaghs hamlet sense and sensibility and heavenly creatures the latter one being my favorite performance of hers in the supporting roles liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher exposing all his bad parts but ultimately being a pretty good person and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as judes wife whom he never divorces jude moves at a very slow pace and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists which would drive some people nuts but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films no matter how slow or downright depressing they are this one is both will appreciate jude though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it ',?

'a fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july from ace ventura to truman burbank jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic yet sympathetic characters s the cable guy was supposed to be his big breakthrough role from zany humor into darker more dramatic acting as most everyone knows the results were well lessthanstellar not only did the film not do so hot at the box office but it was also panned by critics as far as i know gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it the first time i saw the cable guy in theatres i was in super criticmode and didnt really like it however due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day ive had time to lean back relax and take in the film and to my surprise it grew on me the plot is rather simple broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy played by carrey then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship see stevens been having some problems with his girlfriend robin leslie mann and he doesnt think he has any more room in his life for a new friend also some of the cable guys antics have been creeping him out carrey as the cable guy gives steven various aliases which later we find out are all tv characters larry tate chip douglas ricky ricardo etc he apparently lives in his cable van and while many critics didnt enjoy this newer darker lessmanic performance from carrey i thought it was interesting and rather welldone for me its not the movie as a whole thats enjoyable but rather several individual scenes a karaoke jam at stevens apartment a medieval fight at a theme restaurant and a bathroom beating a la liar liar just to name a few perhaps the fact that more of carreys humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny and if you really want to see something youve got to hear his version of jefferson airplanes somebody to love sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam the cable guy has its bad spots like most any movie i didnt particularly like stevens girlfriend and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend also the ending while having you fooled for a moment is rather contrived and somewhat dissapointing still i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture if youre at the video store and cant think of anything to rent i suggest you try it out or if you have hbo just wait till it comes on you wont have to wait long hell thats what i do every day ',?
'arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts since the late s but lately his films have been very sloppy and the oneliners are getting worse its hard seeing arnold as mr freeze in batman and robin especially when he says tons of ice jokes but hey he got million whats it matter to him once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster that cant compare with the likes of the terminator series true lies and even eraser in this so called dark thriller the devil gabriel byrne has come upon earth to impregnate a woman robin tunney which happens every years and basically destroy the world but apparently god has chosen one man and that one man is jericho cane arnold himself with the help of a trusty sidekick kevin pollack they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world parts of this are actually so absurd that they would fit right in with dogma yes the film is that weak but its better than the other blockbuster right now sleepy hollow but it makes the world is not enough look like a star film anyway this definitely doesnt seem like an arnold movie it just wasnt the type of film you can see him doing sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known oneliners but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going its understandable especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources aside form that he still walked through it much like he has in the past few films im sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days speaking of action where was it in this film there was hardly any explosions or fights the devil made a few places explode but arnold wasnt kicking some devil butt the ending was changed to make it more spiritual which undoubtedly ruined the film i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred but once again i was let down i also dont know why the film took so long and cost so much there was really no super affects at all unless you consider an invisible devil who was in it for minutes tops worth the overpriced budget the budget should have gone into a better script where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom its pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie do they even read these things anymore it sure doesnt seem like it thankfully gabriels performance gave some light to this poor film when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney you cant help but feel that he looked like a devil the guy is creepy looking anyway when its all over youre just glad its the end of the movie dont bother to see this if youre expecting a solid action flick because its neither solid nor does it have action its just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing due to a strategic marketing campaign save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience ',?

'ironically one of the themes of cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest because i spent otherwise perfectly good minutes watching this sad excuse for a movie actually smoking cigarettes in the same minutes couldnt be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie not only is it a pathetically bad film overall but cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever the plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of film making resembles a home video it is december and the big party is at monicas martha plimpton house but no one has arrived yet her invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica and some are total strangers but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before nights end those who are invited are the ones that have the issues it is up to those who arent to help them come to terms first there is eric brian mccardie who is a former boyfriend of monicas and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof he is one of the most bland characters in a film full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical a common trait of this poor production bridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela featherstone who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new years eve and tag along to the party with them they stumble across a nameless bartender ben affleck who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections he is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future as he is in law school his lack of flaws is both boring unrealistic and painful to watch as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the substandard comedy moving on there is val christina ricci and stephie gabby hoffman teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts val is monicas cousin and a true fan of the new york scene on the other hand stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just cant find paradoxically it is punks that they meet at a bar actually they attempt to flee from their presence but arent successful who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot wisely the movies creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship however the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening finally there are the two worst performances and worst subplot of the film jack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindys virginity the night before while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy very often when a film is as putrid as this production there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory however this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted instead what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts bad continuity and inaccuracies first and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot at other times objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot there are also at least scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver and yet no matter how miserable this film may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots perhaps if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even a decent plot payoff at the end but it didnt happen that way the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance and every story

'the happy bastards quick movie review wild wild west a better name for this movie mightve been wild wild waste warner bros in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie had managed to lasso in some big names actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld the duo behind mibs success in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster a contemporary bigscreen update to the westernscifi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad but somehow they ran into a problem along the way they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that wouldve made all the difference a story writer wild wild wests story and script was compiled by six different people rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black ed solomon if warner bros had gotten him the movie wouldve possibly been five times better than what it is heck ten times as is however the story and screenplay is a mess filled with dead laughs enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as hes performing them and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well heres the story us army member james west will smith teams up with creative genius artemus gordon kevin kline to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless kenneth branagh whose lower half was blown off during the civil war leaving him to roll around in a steamcontrolled wheelchair they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an foot tarantula although it looks bigger than that hellbent on destroying anything in its path as i said the way the script unfolds is a complete mess but the acting doesnt help either kevin kline is miserable as gordon failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the western silverado smith seems to be having a better time as west although hes not nearly as charming as he was in mib branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain perhaps to the point where we cant even stand to look at him or his strange beard and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father but mostly she exists just for sexual attention her acting is barely passable but what a breath of fresh ass director barry sonnenfeld isnt of great help either even though he shows some good creativity at some points his overall urgency for directing is lost its as if he feels hes directing a tv movie a big nono when youre helming whats supposed to be a bigscreen hit last but not least there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable at one point smith defies gravity when first boarding klines train he jumps on the back gets launched straight up in the air and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train while its still in motion also he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks last but not least why is he still making kissing faces when he knows hes not kissing a woman as hes looking through a peephole at the enemy the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show theres also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades but again a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west but it really isnt possible if the racist and sex jokes dont bother you the performances will if the performances dont bother you the story will if the story doesnt bother you the racist and sex jokes will theres no end to the vicious circle go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats youll have a better time if you do go keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant i bet he wishes he were somewhere else ',?

'edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back and like his previous two it is a relationship picture however unlike his previous work the film dwells on a more personal story and with a female protagonist and in no looking back he stumbles making a slow boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work claudia lauren holly is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life shes at a turning point in her life and feels as if shes going nowhere her boyfriend michael jon bon jovi is broke and in a dead end job if she were to marry him shed never get a chance to escape this town enter charlie edward burns claudias old flame he skipped town several years before without any explanations even for claudia he has come back to town to see her and suddenly she is torn should she stay with stable michael and never escape her hometown or should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again part of the answer lies in the character of her mother blythe danner who fell for the wrong man and has spent her life pining for claudias father to return now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes at only a little past ninety minutes no looking back is rather short for its genre unfortunately it seems much much longer the storyline is simple and uninspired and theres a lack of energy to the whole proceedings which makes the entire drama rather tedious edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame theres no one to restrain his ego which reigns unchecked he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons yeah right lauren holly does what she can with her central character but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions and we never really care bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie his acting talents are much greater than they might seem but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with theres not much to recommend in no looking back its not that the film is bad its simply boring theres no zest in any aspect of the film and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it ',?
'they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movies poster no sequel scary movie is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor and it is not because the wayans brothers shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera dont try what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof the first movie an outrageous lowbrow savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer succeeded because of its takenoprisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue familiar and popular in scary movie the filmmakers take on the haunted houseghost story format which if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series scary movie does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn of course split pea soup is the punch line an overabundant amount which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive but this precredit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university project some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original but they lack that takenoprisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque scary movie merely lurches from one lame sendup to another offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball and the films what lies beneath and hannibal features that only faired adequately at the box office john woos mission impossible and charlies angels it is as if the wayans and their team of writers at least seven are credited just threw ideas in a blender and hoped theyd coalesce they dont while the pace of the original left you breathless the sequel moves with the speed of an wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road you can almost hear the reels panting scary movie tries very hard to live up to its original but it falls very short its a dissatisfying spectacle a very weak sister of a very good movie the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is ',?
' love to kill starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes at the outset the movie appears to be about tony danza whos an illegal distributor of guns trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman danza sets up a double date with her her sister and a collegue of his everything seems to be going well until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs much confusion and mahem ensues as the death is covered up and other associates of danzas begin to emerge all after one thing or another sound confusing it is i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity in some respects it works but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess characters keep popping up with no explanation demanding money for deals that occur offscreen the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead womans sister but so little time is devoted to this part of the story we never really become too familiar with these characters and because of this we dont really care what happens to them well i didnt at least one thing i will give the movie is that its a complete departure for tony danza heres a guy because of his many sitcom roles whos ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing here he plays a man whos just looking out for himself and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin so be it i was very impressed by his performance and within minutes of the start of the film i had forgotten all about his goodguy persona michael madsen is also good as an associate of danzas who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him like i said its not exactly a linear storyline love to kill should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre but its just too bad that the story doesnt really add up to much the stars deserved better and so did the audience ',?
'the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities the best tales of the genre deal with mankinds struggle for survival or knowledge such popular and noteworthy tomes as stranger in a strange land by robert heinlein childhoods end by arthur c clarke and man in the high castle and do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick all deal with mans need for identity and struggle for self worth hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu if not the message of science fiction since its beginnings most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved it really wasnt until producer george pal took charge of robert heinleins novel rocketship galileo and crafted the film destination moon that scifi as it is commonly referred to came into its own from there such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre with the release of touchstone pictures mission to mars we have an unabashedly nonchalant scifi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe the film opens on a summer barbecue as phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission woody blake tim robbins and his wife terri connie nielsen commit to his coming authority on the mission and luc goddard don cheadle consoles his son entering the party is jim mcconnell gary sinise who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife maggie kim delaney luc consoles jim with woodys assistance the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface going out to investigate luc and his team approach the famed face on mars a strange noise emanates from the rock as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar a violent wind storm erupts creating a vortex that kills all members of the team save for luc back on the space station orbiting earth woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing lucs interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger meteorite showers explosions and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planets surface the big question is is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars and if so what is its relationship with us now for the bad news the entire plot of mission to mars is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe the famed face on mars becomes the centerpiece of the film revealing some of the most harebrained scifi pabulum the screen has witnessed borrowing ideas from such films as robinson crusoe on mars quatermass and the pit a space odyssey and even mario bavas planet of the vampires terrore nello spazio mission to mars is a hodgepodge of ideas that dont add up to a satisfying whole while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed the film remains flat and uninvolving so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film but to no good use the performances are all workmen like with only don cheadle as luc carrying any sort of real chemistry gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation and the mistaken idea of having jerry oconnell as phil ohlmyer play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better hes just having too much fun here to give a damn the script has a few lapses namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship also when one character sacrifices himself the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid intrusive score by ennio morricone subtlety is nonexistent here in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower the pacing of the film is very leisurely after the opening introduction of the characters which lasts a full minutes we are finally dropped onto the martian surface then there is another long pause in the plot for more character development including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity the film could lose about minutes and actually gain some momentum there are so many scenes of talking heads discussing what we already know is going to happen that it drags the film to a dead stop the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted with a level of realism that hasnt been seen since a space odyssey the visual effects are just stunning from the space walk sequences to the visualization of evolution on earth the only fault come with the martians themselves which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film the opening sequence alone in a seemingly uninterrupted cut lasting almost minutes an homage to hitchcocks rope as we are introduced to all of the characters scenes in the rescue ship with its rotating centrifuge are just amazing in their execution but the nagging question is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang sadly it is not director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production the set design and visual effects are all arresting but its the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous thought provoking science fiction a disappointing film but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals ',?

'battlefield long boring and just plain stupid battlefield earth a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman in my midteen years i had a horrendous reoccurring nightmare behind the wheel of a car i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway no matter what i did the view didnt change travelling but not getting anywhere each time i awoke in a sweat terrified you dont have to be carl jung to understand that dream powerless to make changes trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake this is exactly how you will feel minutes after battlefield earth begins for all of its flash and style l ron hubbards science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of dull and stupid in the year the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for years humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians theres no hope the future is bleak then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler barry pepper who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl john travolta and the alien race its an archetypal postapocalyptic plot full of promise considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen its difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably but it does the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold the psychlo never discovered fort knox or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time and gassed up or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow dont notice that their slaves are missing for days travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all hes worth and is almost entertaining almost the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person mananimal or not would ever utter some of the film looks good but it also looks so familiar a race of large hulking apelike creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin sound like something charlton heston might be in the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from dune the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their hightech city is something george lucas might have been associated with its too loud its too oppressive its too slow its too long far too long and on it goes the list of the problems with battlefield earth is endless its difficult to find anything in the film that does work oh yeah the color scheme is nice the real question is how this movie ever got made could it have something to do with the fact that l ron hubbard was the founder of scientology and that john travolta is a member of the church that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago but it doesnt give us a clue as to why firsttime screenwriter corey mandells atrocious script was used or why the highprofile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costners the postman which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure be the big budget science fiction failure battlefield earth has the honor sewed up often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video thats not the case here you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one dont hesitate strike now while the iron is cold ',?
'the tagline on random hearts reads in a perfect world they never would have met in a perfect world i never would have seen this movie the biggest flaw is that minutes into this film kay chandler kristin scott thomas and dutch van den broeck harrison ford are the only two major characters alive resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious twohoursandthensome production dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire although they both think they are happily married their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs dutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners they subsequently discover the affair the rest of the film is the pointless unrealistic and oftentimes boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to and getting to know each other in the process two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare all the great stereotypes get pulled including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter kays distraction from the films primary focus is her campaign for reelection and attempts to shield her year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal these sub plots could have made for semiinteresting points but the film seems afraid to explore politics or motherdaughter relations in depth and consequently suffers random hearts two primary characters seem to live in shells although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other there is plenty of opportunity dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack and critically acclaimed upandcomer dylan baker both have cameo roles but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both other than its weak plot it is hard to criticize random hearts however it is also hard to compliment it had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake rather than the dry one that equates to be ',?
'house on haunted hill starring taye diggs geoffrey rush ali larter famke janssen peter gallagher bridgette wilson max perlich lisa loeb james marsters and chris kattan directed by william malone written by dick beebe house on haunted hill initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombielike mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous bhorror flicks with grunting noises and cadaverous movements except this time at the end of the millenium the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be in past horror films the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims house on haunted hill doesnt want their audience to have an imagination everything is provided for them to watch and squirm not think this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film house on haunted hill which is based on the film of the same title introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can following the opening blood fest the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling unexpected shots of blood guts and mayhem however the film is neither scary nor unpredictable the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner geoffrey rush each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them the problem is that every character is not likable the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer taye diggs who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ali larter the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them the worst character in this film or maybe in any film released this year is chris kattans watson pritchett he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself waiting for pritchett to die was a strenuously difficult act to sit through the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price an homage to victor price who starred in the original playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face however rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price played by famke janssen the main problem is that house on haunted hill is not scary to top off that huge disappointment every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped similar to deep blue sea the goal for creating a creepy suspenseful action film was completely missed ',?

'in s many european intellectuals especially those on the left political hemisphere became obsessed with the rise of fascism which wasnt so hard to expect because the social turmoil of s and economic decline of s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies in such times when political involvement could be associated with noble passion many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of prewar europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany of course there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other less noble reasons for them moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era which naturally made some of those films very popular among teen audience one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass who later made career shooting expensive stylish soft porn salon kitty his film is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww in walter schellenberg one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents and that all the rooms happened to be bugged the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty nominal madame of the brothel didnt know the real purpose of that enterprise screenplay by tinto brass of course simplifies the story and changes few names schellenberg is now wallenberg helmut berger ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top kitty kellerman ingrid thulin apart from being madam has a second job as a cabaret singer caught in the net of depravity is sweet innocent girl margerithe theresa ann savoy thrown into brothel there she falls in love with customer hans reiter bekim fehmiu disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel she finds out that the place is bugged she informs the madam of the real situation and both women decide to confront wallenberg those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation but although salon kitty doesnt happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn although not very successful some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict this time between powerhungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty unfortunately brass seems to overuse other cinematical references probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino viscontis the damned but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulins unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minellis musical numbers from cabaret all in all salon kitty is failure although with some very interesting moments ',?

'by the time dennis quaid the ostensible star of switchback makes his first appearance at about the minute mark you may find yourself wondering why he bothered after all writerdirector jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines the first finds amarillo texas sheriff buck olmstead r lee ermey facing a hotlycontested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction as olmstead begins his investigation we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects lane dixon jared leto is an enigmatic young hitchhiker bob goodall danny glover is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the others protagonist but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years hes not supposed to be tracking him any more according to the bureau theyve got their man but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise two months earlier lacrosses own son was kidnapped by the killer and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere lacrosse knows his killers work and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game it wouldnt be fair to reduce everything thats wrong with switchback to quaids presence but its a pretty good place to start theres a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center as a dramatic actor dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tightjawed sourpuss pucker we can tell hes grim because every word comes out in an eastwoodesque rasp a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character pulling the audience into his haunted intensity making switchback his film quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated its tough to become emotionally invested in a characters turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes even without quaid it doesnt appear that switchback would have stayed on course the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy building our curiosity over which man the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor is the real threat unfortunately stuart tips his hand far too early in the game both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal once the mystery of the killers identity is dispatched the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable in fact stale and predictable describes the direction that switchback takes in general falling back on fartoocommon hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere a climactic fistfight on board a freight train and edgy law enforcement agents its too bad stuart wasnt willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film played with atypical restraint by r lee ermey hes a wonderful unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a filmmaker willing to take a few risks with his casting and storytelling instead stuart places his trust in a name star who cant carry the material maybe next time hell throw away that one crucial page in the script the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story ',?
'i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws but if you ask me the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american or more the point anyone that allows him to bask in his own lessthansubtle presence this is not an insult to gere as i consider him to be a rather talented actor  but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role if a film is solely about one person the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work although geres performance is in no way poorly acted it is far from perfect  and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself this is where he truly belongs and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear with the sensational edward norton the jackal with bruce willis and pretty woman with the delightful julia roberts in red corner gere plays lawyer jack moore who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear  bold and up front who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room  drunk and cheerful yet instead of a hangover poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison his cell food and rights  all terrible now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy lawyer shen yuelin bai ling defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder jack and shen argue about their countries different laws shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family  as the plot thickens scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected butyouknewalong criminal is discovered red corner is one of those films where you sneer laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act this is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly the basic idea is quite tangible it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate the evidence that goes missing the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before if that wasnt bad enough red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself taking itself far too seriously red corner is not half the film it intends to be although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast the films main fault is in the bizarre and often out of place way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again martin vailwhere are you ',?
'i didnt hate the big hit even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film for the entirety of its running time my eyes were attached to the screen and i never once got bored i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness this is such a confused disaster of a film that its entertaining to watch it in the same way that its entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl as a narrative the big hit is pure garbage never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways its fine to mix genres if the film makers know what theyre doing unfortunately writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong dont seem to know how to handle the material and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy the biggest problem with the amalgamation in this case is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place but it sure is a fascinating failure marky er mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley a hitman hes a good hitman apparently although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious he doesnt snipe or make clean killshe just kicks the door down and shoots everything he works with a few other hitmencisco lou diamond phillips crunch bokeem woodbine and vinnie antonio sabbato jr theyre a nice bunch of muscular guys who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex they all work for a man named paris avery brooks who is rich powerful and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own this of course is where the plot comes in they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko china chow who has a rich father when they do this it turns out she is paris goddaughter its very bad to have paris against you the story is standard action film stuff its nothing new and nothing particularly offensive but certainly not the slightest bit compelling clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that its a john wootype of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy its true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea such as faceoff and the replacement killers which are both far superior there are stunts that are fun to watch the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns melvin is also very good at breakdancing and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives like i said its not boring most disasters arent what makes it so bad is its genreshifting madness it seems to start out as a quirkybutrealistic action comedy as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains then as soon as they go to their first hit it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere then somewhere in between it turns back into comedy keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl in one amusing scene she is forced to read a letter out loud indicating that she has been kidnapped but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words and scenes like this work alone but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious or not be in the film at all one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped when cisco gets there paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it but they let him out of there telling him to find the perpetrator the scene is played for laughs but it isnt funny and since it doesnt quite work as a comedy it tries to fall back on the action which also fails this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun cars land on tree branches and are supported by them characters betray each other without a second thought grenades are thrown in tight places people jump out of tall buildings and survive people outrun tumbling cars and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds most frustrating of all though is the films definition of a hit man these guys are anything but subtle quiet and skilled individuals theyre more like socially depraved militia men melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage including missile launchers and handheld machineguns the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest this obviously doesnt make for deep or interesting people to watch the acting is kind of fun thoughwahlberg is a good actor and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character while christina applegate who plays melvins fianc e is convincingly airheaded the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny the funniest parts are supplied by the actors and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and oneliners its a true disaster one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional despite all this though i must reiterate the entertainment value here you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is you just might enjoy yourself ',?

'deadbang an action thriller starring don johnson lives up to its dumb title or at least to half of it although deadbang is definitely dead it is anything but a bang in fact they should have called this one dead bore in the film johnson plays you guessed it a cop the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character jerry beck is a gritty los angeles homicide detective a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on miami vice a la mel gibson in lethal weapon beck is an emotional wreck complete with violent outbursts unscrupulous police methods and a bleak outlook on life becks wife has just divorced him and she is cutting him off from their children she will not even allow him to wish them merry christmas by telephone but becks family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in deadbang beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop his investigation starts in l a and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp virtually every aspect of deadbang is inept and ineffective the plot is incoherent and full of holes the movie depicts becks investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions the action sequences in deadbang are strictly thirdrate and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense i certainly expected more from longtime director john frankenheimer who directed the political thriller the manchurian candidateas well as black sunday seven days in may and the french connection ii in all fairness to frankenheimer however i should note that most of deadbangs shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction deadbang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting according to the movies production notes deadbang is based on the reallife experiences of stillactive detective jerry beck you would never guess this from watching deadbang however since the film totally lacks credibility it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable most of the characters in deadbang are either atrociously acted underdeveloped superfluous or all of the above william forsythe for example is painfully bad as arthur kressler a wholesome bythebook fbi agent whos offended by becks foul language and unorthodox methods forsythes lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable deadbang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid wkrp in cincinnati and franks place but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains the sole function of penelope ann millers character is to give deadbang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less i guess the films title refers to this love scene since its definitely a dead bang the only real virtue of deadbang believe it or not is don johnson who tries to overcome the limitations of the movies pitiful script johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life and i must admit that deadbang does have one or two amusing moments the funniest scene has johnson throwingup all over a criminal as he interrogates him but when barf is the highlight of a movie you know the movies in trouble the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck in which he cant keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make ',?

'for his directoral debut gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent alcoholic husband and father and the various lives he affects but while the characters places and events may have special meaning to the writerdirector the audience is left in the dark the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ray winstone and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars then he returns home to his pregnant wife valerie kathy burke and their fiveyearold daughter raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies and his paranoid delusions early on when he accuses valeries brother billy charlie creedmiles of stealing raymond then proceed to beat and bite him to a bloody wreck but these are the least of billys problems billy is a heroin addict on the downturn and it doesnt seem that hell last much longer billy and valeries mother janet laila morse is raymonds nemesis she disapproves of him and he of her but is powerless to do anything about it she merely struggles on hoping her children will survive their respective torments if this description seems bleak i havent told the half of it this is not a cheery movie and most of the time its downright depressing while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him in the end its not quite worth it there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose take for example the extended sequence where one of billys scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy the film is filled with these character moments that never really achieve anything granted there are a few genuinely powerful and sickening moments in the film but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us the actors do a fine job particularly in the central roles the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into the bad thing about an actor turned director is that theres no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience oldman got it about half right ',?

'from a major league baseball radio broadcast featuring playby play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown with special guest commentator james berardinelli hc as we go to the top of the th were joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli whos here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie major league back to the minors the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors nice to see you jim as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer can you give us the scoop on the new flick jb my opinion the producers should have stopped while they were ahead and that was nine years ago one entry was definitely enough and im surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released directtovideo its worse than a mediocre madefortv feature i should also mention that this movie likely wont play all that well in cleveland now that the real indians are perennial contenders they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks actually most of the action involves the twins aaa minor league club the buzz rather than the actual major league franchise hc sorry to interrupt jim but we still have to do playbyplay for the game on the field leading off this inning is john warren he steps into the batters box and takes kents pitch low for ball one wh so the storys strictly minor league right whats it about jb scott bakula the guy from quantum leap plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell when twins owner roger dorn once again portrayed by corbin bernsen needs a new manager for his aaa team he offers the job to gus who is now faced with two daunting tasks turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson played by walt goggins for a promotion to the show with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano dennis haysbert rube baker eric bruskotter and isuro tanaka takaaki ishibashi gus gets the buzz on the right track in fact he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the bigleague club leonard huff played with overthetop relish by ted mcginley soon dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus overachieving group against huffs overpaid lastplace bunch wh can we guess who wins jb the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when youve already seen the box score on top of that none of the mockups are presented with much flair theyre not just boring theyre lackluster but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension theyve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs hc warren fouls off a fastball and wh are there lots of yuks in this one jb not one from start to finish i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny okay a lot of the jokes were sophomoric but they made me laugh the two sequels havent just been stale but their humor quotient has been abysmally low even bob ueckers oncesharp oneliners have turned lame and theyre the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing hc heres the pitch looooooong drive fair or foul foul ball the count goes to and wh does the film at least get the baseball details correct jb yes there arent any glaring errors like there were in one of the bestever baseball movies the natural but id gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story believable characters or even a little genuine humor heck the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league back to the minors wh its nice to see old friends one more time isnt it like cerrano tanaka and dorn jb depends on whether you really care that anyone is back there arent any real characters here just an assortment of cliched oddballs yeah the voodoo hitter the catcher who cant throw back to the pitcher the japanese player and the conceited playerturnedowner have all returned but who really cares they have no depth notable absences include tom berengers veteran and charlie sheens wild thing we dont really miss them though hc breaking ball low and outside and wh so youre saying that we should give this one a miss jb thats right to use baseball terminology its a threepitch strikeout if youre looking for a good movie that involves baseball try popping the natural field of dreams bull durham or even the first major league into the vcr actually this is an oddlytimed release since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters even the minor league seasons are already underway dont bother with major league back to the minors its a wretched time waster wh thanks for the advice jb youre welcome hc and heres the pitch fouled back right into this booth hey jim heads up oops somebody better get him some ice for that he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him almost as if he has a grudge to settle anyway back to the action on the field ',?

'man this was one wierd movie similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldnt decide which genre it is the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship the last half hour this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided screw it lets just kill everybody from then on forget scifi this movie becomes horror what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare this movie just uses loud noises sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore yawn everyones seen it all before and knows when to expect it the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed but what did this then finally after being painfully restored the new crew views the video the acting isnt too bad at all considering what the actors had to work with anyway as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space this movie could have been so much better it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with there was just nothing new here that any of us havent seen before in aliens or hellraiser ',?

'theres a foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact id say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies which are getting more irwin allen esque with every release the early wave of this revival while just as cheesy and laughable at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking the repeating cycle is as follows the president morgan freeman will go on tv and tell the country that theres a remote chance a comet will strike the earth but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem then we get to see the plan in action in some sequence utterly lacking suspense the mission will barely fail and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth and theres a remote chance it will strike but that the nations crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem it goes on and on throughout the movie but every time freeman goes on tv we know his plan is going to fail how do we know this because weve seen the tv ads for deep impact ads that feature freeman telling the nation that the comet is still headed right for us and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading ladies and gentlemen that is the movie successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its second tv spots television is whats wrong with deep impact the main character played by tea leoni is a lowlevel broadcast journalist for msnbc and thats the mere tip of the productplacement iceberg who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy she thinks its an instance of an exsecretary of something or other james cromwell resigning because of a mistress and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area when she goes nosing around cromwell he begs her to keep it under wraps i know youre just a reporter but you used to be a human being she figures out whats really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction level comet upon a topsecret meeting with president freeman leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference at which she gets to ask the first question and everyone knows if you get to ask the first question baby youre a star leoni ends up in the anchor chair broadcasting every step of the comets collision course with earth and im sure its comforting for her to know that even though the worlds ending in a matter of months shes a cable news personality so there she is narrating the sixastronaut mission to blow the comet up such personalities as robert duvall jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this draggedout process but as anyone whos seen the commercials knows the astronauts fail they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces which means even more destruction to the earth yeah thanks nasa thats when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who arent picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years they even have animals two by two ready to climb into the cave if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife while people pack the highways out of town the reasoning is of course that if a comet is going to strike they might as well be out in some scenic rural location and amusingly the highway is spotted with people in uhaul trucks im sure its comforting to know that even though the worlds ending in a matter of minutes the uhaul people are doing the most business of their lives ',?
'perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with this is the fake news norm macdonald at times could elicit some laughter by blurting out semioffensive phrases in his raspy voice coated with a condescending attitude his shtick was marked by crassness in this movie for example when his girlfriend says that shes kicking him out because hes been fired from different jobs over the last months he tries to calm the situation by saying maybe youll feel better after we have some dirty sex this kind of humor can only go so far but certainly cant go the distance in a fulllength feature dirty work is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically emotionally theyve never outgrown their pubescent years which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback although having no apparent real world skills the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people if the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart mitch norm macdonald and sam artie lange need to come up with in a period of two weeks so that sams dad jack warden can have a heart operation their idea is to start a revengeforhire business where theyll do your dirty work in the funniest scene and possibly the only funny scene of the movie they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot their presence is established but when a lessthanhonorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge by default dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots but it delivers jerky boys level material except for the bit at the used car lot and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call already weak on material it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs broads and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction but whats really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying note to self note to self learn to fight he says after getting beat up note to self theres always beer he says after hitting rock bottom etc we feel like were just watching an elongated rehash of his notsoglorious days on saturday night live much like the television show for minutes we get one or two funny bits the rest of the story is just dead space ',?
'tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss he goes into depression and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual ghetto side of every american city there lawernce attempts to steal his car but to no avail and is dragged along with robbins on a trip to arizona there they hold up a store are mistaken for two other robbers just like in my cousin vinny and are chased by the police and the other robbers of course theres gags along the way usually from lawernce although the film is midly funny and quite watchable theres something so horribly familiar about it all this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run theres lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop and pratically the same idea as midnight run its full of all the road movie cliches and even has a comedy car chase which just seemed so eighties even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin or chevy chase eighties comedy there also isnt much chemistry between robbins and lawernce in planes trains and automobiles there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy in nothing to lose there is hardly chemistry at all towards the end the chemistry seems to work but for the bulk of the film there is hardly any the director directs the film in a workman like fashion but gets the jokes across and although there is no chemistry between the two leads they give good performances on their own lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance and robbins is alright aswell however robbins performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacobs ladder and the player in fact if you want to see robbins do comedy much better than in nothing to lose i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy where he is much funnier nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it however the humour isnt particulary sophisticated but if you enojyed dumb dumber you might enjoy this the characters in arizona are funny and theres also a good scene where robbins asks a shopkeeper which threatening approach was better lawerences which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeepers ass and swearing a lot or himselfs which was speaking in a deep scary voice but the gags are predictable the lack of chemistry infurating and the ending too farfetched and perfect nothing to lose then is robbins first bad movie and hopefully his last and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film he nearly ruined carreys career with ace ventura when nature calls lets hope he hasnt ruined robbins or even lawerences with nothing to lose ',?
'at the outset of swordfish john travoltas gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today basically he says it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers how ironic as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture swordfish is loud violent and amoral it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life and how does travoltas gabriel plan to do this by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to outterrorize terrorists swordfish is a very cynical movie it relies on an audiences perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as nonhuman faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration the movies plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down youd actually see how ridiculous it all is this is a liveaction road runner cartoon moving so quickly that its over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson hugh jackman recruited by gabriel to crack the governments computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his antiterrorist campaign talk about whackedout patriotism my objections to swordfish are many the body count is high but that is expected in a movie of this sort its becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers police officers and government agents blown to bits another example is the family dynamics between stanley his yearold daughter and his exwife stanley though having served time in prison for hacking is shown as a loving and caring father forbidden by his ex to see his little girl audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husbands adult films thus when she is found murdered late in the movie neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve in fact subconsciously many in the audience are probably glad she was killed then there is the sequence involving one of gabriels henchman holding a gun to the head of stanleys daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich in recent films there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them onscreen victims as well yea its only make believe but that doesnt mean you have to tolerate it travolta is cool deadly charming and flamboyant as the nearcrazy gabriel his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and faceoff jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriels assistant while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel swordfish plays like a comic book with a largerthanlife character in gabriel viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain and maybe that is the movies underlying flaw there is no real hero to speak of only those doing their upmost to survive and that is not enough this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water ',?

'absolute power the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence continually underestimating the audience the film gives us information we already know or dont even need details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two nightvision goggles in their car oddly enough the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities a masterful jewelthief played by clint eastwood witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire played by e g marshall while robbing one of marshalls mansions he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault there through a twoway mirror he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman in self defense the woman grabs a letteropener and stabs the man in the elbow she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men the man he is the president of the united states of america where does the film go wrong it cannot be the acting clint eastwood ed harris and gene hackman as the president give typecast but decent performances the cinematography is sufficient wild and erratic during action sequences dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thrillersuspense genre the fault clearly lies in the screenplay and the screenplay alone while setting up a story about misuse of power about the true possessors of that power and about intrigue and doublecrossing it does not resolve it not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax rather the tense situations are left dangling at the end giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant police officers are everywhere incognito of course at the same time not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives all three parties are unaware of each others presence this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood who might suspect this is a trap will get himself out of this difficult position he will probably have a brilliant plan involving ingenious preparations however when he arrives at the trap both hit men miss how convenient and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap the scene was resolved in less than seconds parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter the daughter blames her father for never being there for her because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family again it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot however trying is simply not enough the second story line should be subtle original and preferably unpredictable everything this film is not how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced how could eastwood who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven ever believe in a project like this one i am sad to say that my respect for the actordirectorproducer has diminished substantially due to this film director quentin tarantino once said i can make a good movie out of any bad script director clint eastwood obviously cannot ',?

'if youre the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn butter optional then this is the movie for you indeed this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative ripoffs of other recent action movies or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them its difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film but at least were warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie first the movie gives us an introductory premise huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor and in this area many ships have disappeared oooh scary secondly a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score third the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo treat williams he operates a sophisticated militarystyle pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy finally in the cargo hold we see those that hired him they are also mercenaries that have toughlooking haircuts talk with accents and try to show how macho they are during their trip across the stormy sea their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs spotting a cruise ship in the distance they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop take the parts that they need and then continue on their merry way little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster yet they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds this is nothing more than a bythebook action film their realization of the situation that theyre in doesnt happen until they are in the bowels of the boat those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed the corridors on the ship are narrow misty and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scarefests must have yet despite the predictable nature of this film there are some scary boo moments but most of it is just outright silly and this film is unusually gory too monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive he screams horribly as the monsters digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away additionally it borrows heavily from speed alien and a bunch of other recent films the mercenaries even run into a lone surviving passenger femke jannsen who looks amazingly like sandra bullock to be honest when i left the theatre i just had to laugh at how witless the film was its moronic fun at best so if youre hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness then this might just hit the spot ',?
'whats to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornographyie the garbage known as snuff films nothing right whats to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography well nothing so why make it hollywood theres no reason why the average sane moviegoer will be interested in such a topic no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this the lack of quality filmmaking in mm from technical to acting stands out even more when you consider the star writer and supporting castall reputable but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again like paul schrader schumacher has his moments but theyre few and far far between basically this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it why not walk out well this wouldnt be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie heres why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of mm first thingif you dont heed my advice then understand what youre about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud its not easy to watch i didnt know the details of the story beforehand but at least my ignorance can help others now the ha plot revolves around tom welles nicolas cage as a surveillance expert and private investigator a rich old woman discovers a snuff film in her late husbands safe she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl it had to be a young girl didnt it schumacher who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead shes horrified that her husband would have owned such a film in mm of course and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find familyman welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque murder let me backtrack for a moment see snuff films are pornos with a violent twistpeople are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead however the deaths are often staged and in those cases special effects and good acting make all the difference very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hardtofind movies the thought of this industry makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review but ill swallow my bile and move on welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry youd think hes sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him he comes across smut clerk max joaquin phoenix who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze after a lot of digging and bribing welles finds the men who are responsible for making this and other snuff films skip ahead skip ahead skip ahead led by dino velvet peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance and startorturer machine christopher bauer they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue the movie doesnt end there unfortunately because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films dobecome a vigilante this film doesnt draw you in it keeps you about miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ie seen but it takes a large measure of restraint schumacher has none and a larger amount of talent schumacher has little by those jabs im not only referring to his stylish destruction of the batman franchise but a time to kill was an immensely overrated disappointment for a guy who gets so much studio money his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter writer andrew kevin walker didnt recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for s twisted thriller seen director schumacher doesnt have that innate ability to make you watch things you dont really want to see like better directors are capable of doing he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we dont see is more frightening than what we do especially when its a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered however gratuitous is joels middle name he must think that not flaunting a hardcore act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint no he doesnt go that far but we see enough unpleasantness he doesnt leave much to the imagination its manipulating to hurt or kill young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ha ha craft case in point a shot of a christian fellowship bus good right drives away to reveal one of the villains bad right see no subtlety does joel think were stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery who do we root for in this mess is there anybody out there its not all the directors fault though why did the actors sign up for this nicolas cage is an oscarwinner for cryin out loud if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda what is cage supposed to be in this moviea whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash he was so solid as a concerned father in a civil action i guess ol nic pete and jim were promised a mountain of money or theyre suckers or they just dont care there are moments albeit brief ones where this rises above the wasteland catherine keener is good although too quick to threaten divorce as mrs wells baby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet the mother amy norton of the girl in the infamous mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter this film has an appropriate bluetoned washedout look like payback which was a much better movie the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue but at other times its rough during some conversations closeups and wide shots are not cut very well making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts arent good and whose timing was a halfsecond off such a technical error indeed stands out speaking of standing out dont believe the misleading trailers theres not much action here occasionally yes but not as often as your tv will have you believe after seeing mm i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again is that a positive well if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive theyve done a swell job here itll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chanceunless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved but today im not depraved so i ask why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it im sure that somewhere right now theres some pretty sick crap going on but that doesnt mean i need to know about it yes mr walker your script tells us that there are some screwedup folks out there yes mr walker the proverbial monster doesnt look like we expect him to you said all that in move on this film serves no purpose it doesnt entertain it doesnt teach us anything it doesnt make a statement beyond the obvious this stuff is bad approach only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile thats not likely to happen though so mm is indeed a scummy waste of money orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film to movies to good movies if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole like snuff films mm should never have been made now excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it useless triviajoel schumacher loves the vigilante theme he used it in batman forever in batman robin in a time to kill in falling down and its rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow ',?

'any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project as a perfect murder illustrates frankly dial m for murder is not one of the master directors greatest efforts so there is ample room for improvement unfortunately instead of updating the script ironing out some of the faults and speeding up the pace a little a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder leaving behind the nearly unwatchable wreckage of a wouldbe s thriller almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in whats going on so that these flaws in logic dont become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled unfortunately in a perfect murder the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as theyre happening this is a very bad sign not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder of course in the case of a perfect murder at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless cardboard characters a perfect murder isnt a strict remake of dial m for murder but it does borrow heavily from frederick knotts play which was also the source material for hitchcocks version as well as a madefortv retelling emily hayes gwyneth paltrow is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street moverandshaker steven hayes michael douglas their marriage isnt going well emily resents stevens controlling instincts and as a form of rebellion she is having an affair with a penniless painter david shaw viggo mortensen when steven learns of the relationship he decides to confront david but his approach isnt that of a typical cuckolded husband instead of yelling or threatening steven offers david a proposal thats too good to resist for in cash before the rest after he is to break into stevens new york apartment and kill emily of course after getting the first payment david never bothers to ask how hes supposed to get the rest ultimately im not sure which of the three main characters were supposed to be sympathetic to the coldhearted husband who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune her mercenary lover who is willing to do the deed for halfamillion or the woman who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable but theyre not interesting its possible to make a good movie with detestable characters see reservoir dogs but there has to be something compelling about them which in this case there isnt steven emily and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting text book on stereotypes the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep hes gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife gwyneth paltrow who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors is simply awful here she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of s worst thrillers the other being hush at least viggo mortensen g i jane has a little fun with his part but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies the thin supporting cast includes david suchet the star of poirot as a police inspector and sarita choudhury kama sutra as emilys best friend a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end there arent many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start its surprising to see director andrew davis the man behind the fugitive involved in this mess but like his stars he too needs to earn a living its just that remaking hitchcock and doing it so badly hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough ',?

'this is an adaptation of h g wells acclaimed novel the invisible man the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue the director is paul verhoven that plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer should be enough to lure us into the theatre the problem is to keep us there i cant imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time working on a top secret military project sebastian caine kevin beacon an eccentric genius that calls himself god has discovered the secret to invisibility the first two faces are completed now it is time for the next logical step human caine volunteers for this risky experiment but when he is made invisible something goes wrong while his exgirlfriend linda elisabeth shue desperately tries to find something to return him to normal he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower but thats not the bad thing an unexpected sideeffect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine soon every sense of decency is forgotten the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alienripoff where caine is walking like a half finished terminator spooking scaring and killing everybody though its based on a novel called the invisible man the title has been ironically changed to hollow man that sums up the film very nicely this is a very silly production laughable actually apparently verhovens imagination doesnt stretch too far for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls locker room undetected it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie being invisible gives you the opportunity to be who you are to do what you want without being influenced by society in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about all that the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man but since this is a modernization in other words a dehumanization he doesnt stop there he becomes a rapist and then of course a murderer youll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place shues talent is barely seen josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully his face is not seen for the most part of the film and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place being probably the best technical achievement since jurassic park they are absolutely amazing we observe the layers of skin muscle tissue and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible we see a beating heart inflating lungs and veins pulsing with newlypumped blood there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke fire air and water but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for what is truly disturbing is that with a great book talented actors and a grand budget this could have been so much more pretty much like jan de bont twister haunting paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary he was responsible for several good films basic instinct and starship troopers and some incredibly bad films showgirls total recall but he has never made anything that was great in a way hollow man fits perfectly in this collection its not better or worse than verhovens average film he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues and so instead of depth and chills verhoven inserts some of his trademarks stupid dialogue and lots of dull action with blood and naked bodies he even throws in some of the worst of film clich s the slowly advancing fireball the villain who comes back from the dead etc etc and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year youll be screaming nooooo and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion and all we can ask is why the answer is simple though hollywood is a movie producing machine the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money it has to be about telling stories not marketing them it has to be about transporting us to a different place to dazzle us with magic and cleverness to make us care to make us think and feel verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that its all flesh and bones but no soul a void where its imagination should be ',?

'in the continuation of warner brothers franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film avika goldsmans screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as the client is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstones batgirl who just happens to be alfreds niece the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live now the logic of that little subplot escapes me if mr freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth this is indeed a cold hearted man the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal she joins with mr freeze in his plan to start a new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them the characters have no logic batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships while at the same time not really having any george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him to say that his performance is workmanlike is to be generous his best performances are still on e r bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend played by elle macpherson that it brings into question bruces latent homosexuality there is no spark and no passion as there was for nicole kidmans psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred and even that relationship is very reserved robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series now hes just a spoiled kid in batman forever burt ward wanted to be batmans partner and friend now robin is suffering from ego deficiency robins attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for a boy around the age of his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest even though they are not related in a traditional sense chris odonnell once considered a rising star successfully burns up on reentry with this performance his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking the less said about alicia silverstones performance the better this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it this brings us to the villains arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday the most rediculous scene is during mr freezes imprisonment the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film its almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film without going through the intricacies of the plot there is one question that always comes to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel mr freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video every villain even the minor ones have to have a look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume with this film warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to its tv incarnation the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows gwaaaas and clangs associated with the old series you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film the special effects by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary stars of this film and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing every set from ivys lair the batcave to freezes hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film everything is set for maximum exposure the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series master shots pepper the action scenes destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had mr schumacher is a good director one just has to look back on the films the lost boys cousins an underrated film and the client to know that but batman and robin comes off as a mated made for tv movie the film has no style of individuality it is the cinematic equivalent to jello pretty to look at but empty it is unfortunate that this film even with its surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warners thought tim burton would do with the franchise kill it joel schumachers batman robin is loud colorful action packed and ultimately boring stars ',?
'if youve seen the trailers or commercials its rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store well its hard to tell after watching the movie as well bruce willis is a resident of the future and it is a rather bleak future the worlds population had disintigrated into a mere and is no longer ruled by humans but animals the reason in an organization called the army of the monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus thus wiping out practically the worlds population in a mere month bruce willis character is one of the surviving few but is enslaved by scientists as are most of last living humans they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task go into the past find the leader of the army of the monkeys and kill him well this explanation didnt come easy although the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people our future and the evilo in the world as a story it is very confusing and dragging i know a movie isnt keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that its only been an hour passed terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate and i havent watched his previous work brazil but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out you wish it were more complex and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me ',?
'i have never been so confused after watching a movie meet joe black is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year with a cinematography music and cast that will dazzle most of us at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season at first you marvel at the elegant direction graceful cinematography and sensual musical score then youll wait for something to happen for half an hour but when you finally understand whats going on youll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this the script is simply a silly and unresolved story which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture it feels like an eternity most of the time it is a pompous soap opera filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and meaningful winks the film is based on alberto caesellas play death takes a holiday the story concentrates around bill anthony hopkins who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying yes soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen brad pitt who introduces himself as death it is bills time but death has other plans it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive our bill is chosen to be deaths guide and in exchange he gets time bill introduces death as joe black who immediately becomes the center of everyones attention bills business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bills side lives in his house and resides at his office that is not all however bills youngest daughter susan claire forlani falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences it wouldnt be fair to say that this film didnt have some interesting moments such as the scene where joe is invited to join bills family for dinner when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love the experience is somewhat different it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure its one thing to say wouldnt it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth to create a motion picture out of this is another four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest scent of a woman hopkins looks great in any role and no matter how shallow or hollow it is he will complete it his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time how can you play death in human form to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters they are not creatures but phenomenas saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work speaking in a calm soft voice portraying death as a lonely distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters he looks and acts more like an angel of death rather than a demon or a redeyed executioner claire forlani and others are also fine stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery in other words this is not what i expected from the director of scent of a woman it could and should be better with such cast and crew in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera ',?
'in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early s came this frenchcanadian coproduction by max fischer the movie is set in paris where its hero struggling american author david mirkine judd nelson at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity suffers a terrible writers bloc he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle laurence treill unfortunately she hangs out in jet set circles which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous her connection with powerful david caravan pierce brosnan would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller drama would probably be more appropriate genre label pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments low budget also becomes painfully visible and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film unfortunately this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed instead they would have to settle with pointless slow scenes involving nelson brosnan and laurence treills attempts of serious acting all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someones precious time ',?

'arriving in a barrage of hype the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year however like the golden child although blair witch has made a lot of money its not very good donahue williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles although events start of normal they get weird pretty quickly while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on although an interesting premise the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise most of the dialogue is adlibbed and still manages to sound like a poor bmovie the script eventually degenerates into shouting matches with the fword included a lot to sound like students there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur but then its back to the shouting and swearing which gets very tiresome very quickly if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods shout a lot and swear id go on scout camp but no the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this but im not quite sure how the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes with no music and no budget to work with the film has to depend on natural psychological scares which are sometimes well delivered sometimes not i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film however because the actors are so irritating the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying what the f ck is that a lot and mike giggling like a loony theres also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment and are hopelessly lost heather still insists on filming it all the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this but it isnt very convincing also the students have no idea how to survive in the woods such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation there are also some parts where the amateur camcorder footage is obviously staged heathers apology being a major one the blair witch project in the end just fails to deliver i suppose if youve been lost camping before the film may deliver some chills but this is no use for the other of the paying audience who havent been lost in the woods apart from the final minutes the film is mind boggingly unscary and the shouting matches get hideously dull the spook scenes are short and far between and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide although a good idea its not executed well enough to be a fun scary cinema experience its a worrying fact when the website http www blairwitch com is better than the film ',?

'as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding especially three times but alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber its amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor well this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber but it seems to have a life of its own this is there strictly for the kids the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at get his fiancee back finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire and do all this in the funniest way possible admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original the absent minded professor the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable the basketball players stereotypically unqualified for the sport somehow manage to bounce fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning this just sounds too bad to be true the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie giving life to the flubber which is so poorly executed that its best forgotten and prof brainards flying robot weebo giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasnt for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well but it wasnt and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good now weebo is a totally different story its a robot that prof brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too this is a really original idea well maybe not but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all the acting by robin williams prof brainard seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to people when stood up at the altar dont usually give third chances or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards but what can be expected this is a childrens movie flubber as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect with the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great it does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end but it does not wash up to the original kids should find this movie amusing and fun and theyll probably enjoy the whole movie as a movie its just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that ',?

'for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking or whats left of it in mainstream hollywood movie which are star vehicles are terrible things as a rule the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor an actor might be chosen on the upandup to give him exposure or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck generally though the actor doesnt matter and soldier the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers exemplifies this the picture lacks pizazz the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less russell plays todd a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought the movie lets us see this degenerate process but by the time the real plot starts were into todds later years hes about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers ones who instead of being trained from birth are genetically selected before birth the pride of this caine jason scott lee will be our villain and you know hes the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movies start between the two leads less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken and its possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction director paul anderson who helmed last years icy thriller event horizon doesnt show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam todd upon being replaced is left to die on a garbage planet but in order to stretch the running time out the villains return to the garbage planet on a routine patrol and set the stage for the final firefight events are predictable from the time that the setups are made and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be todd fails to show physical superiority against caine in fact not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry its not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit and treat it as a parody of typical action fare like universal soldier a strict interpretation however reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style or substance and by next year a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television ',?
'you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year theyre obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big boxoffice holiday season combine that with howie longs first starring action role and youve got a doozy of a movie that while not as bad as it could have been isnt a very good film howie stars as an ace smokejumper a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground in the slightly contrived opening scenes we witness his heroism in action as he and his mentor played by scott glenn attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire william forsythe plays the bad guy a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak he and five convict cohorts manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards but since there must be a movie luck is with him soon the nowescaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters why canadian who knows eh along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher suzy amis to be their hostage enter howie long hes called in to help fight the blaze and when he spots the group of ground pounders apparently lost he parachutes in to help when he discovers their true identity he is the only thing standing between them and escape and the only hope of help for the hostage longs acting talents are above those of say steven seagal but not by much although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden hes a likeable hero and there are some hints here and there that he may get better the script doesnt help him out any however all too often it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny the dialogue is strictly bmovie material and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable longs costars are a mixed bag at least theyre all comfortable in their respective roles forsythe has the scenerychewing villain down cold down cold and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch even when he doesnt seem to be stretching his talents as is definitely the case here suzy amis plays peril pretty well but isnt given much more to do some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting but many are rather bland youd think that the director dean semler a former cinematographer would at least produce a film with interesting visuals thats not the case theres a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences weve seen this stuff before its not the most auspicious start to but it could have been worse just think back to s debut biodome however after a month of oscarcaliber pictures a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were in fact theres a good chance that some of them are still playing near you ',?
'at first glance i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise its plotline goes like this the evil king cromwell desiring to take over the world resurrects an evil ancient sorceror xusia for power he attacks the kingdom of ehdan and kills young prince talons parents given a triplebladed sword which can shoot bad guys like a gun by his dying father talon vows for revenge eleven years later when hes established his own army the mercaneries he vows to take back his kingdom along the way he meets up with alana whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell talon vows to help and after a series of minor escapades eventually ends up rescuing alanas brother and several other prisoners only to be captured himself in other words put on a cross to be crucified fortunately he frees himself rescues alana from marrying cromwell defeats xusia and then cromwell all with his triple bladed sword during the final battle the blade breaks but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade then everything ends happily unfortunately the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping bad acting and gruesomely gory bloody scenes never once does the story seem to connect together it just jumps around repeatedly this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia after telling him that he needs his help he leads the warlock out into daylight but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards wait a minute didnt the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade ehdan which he cannot do by military force if that is the case why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him and why does he manage to take over ehdan anyway these questions are just never no never answered in the film another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alanas wedding to cromwell and finally at the end instead of settling down with alana he just tells her to wait and then he just rides off in addition to the extremely bloody scenes this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure even some attempts to make it exciting a few fire scenes battle scenes dont work it just completely fails altogether miserably the only good thing about this film is its musical score contributed by david whittaker who had an extremely short music composing career the score is boomy and adventurous powerful and a billion times better than this film is my suggestion steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead if you can find it ironically though before the films credits roll there is a message indicating that a sequel tales of the ancient empire would follow to my relief and delight it never got into production because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office grossing only million critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer all right leonard maltin rightfully called it second rate in scripting and acting and ataglance film reviews called it a confusing stupid unimaginative unengaging bloodfilled bore i totally agree with these reviews all right and i hope that this piece of will be forgotten about there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer i hope you get a good laugh out of this review but i am not laughing in fact my insults dont even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its minute running time ',?

'this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled bluecollar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times it is hard to tell what is independent about this film it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam it is the debut film for the director who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the s where the mindset of all the characters depicted is grounded but to see it in the s is a different story it is old news the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesnt mean much since their relationship remained undeveloped the introduction of the wiseguy angle and the loyality among buddies bit are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tourdeforce performance by the star of the film adrien brody as ray ray is the only son of a lowlevel mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield new jersey suburban basement ray sr vincent is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale homerepair business his son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his longtime waitress girlfriend joanne sybil the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newmanb which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film you should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that dont make sense its constant brainless chatter between the buddies their uneventful growing pains and the despair of their lives make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them desperate to make his dream come through ray goes to a loanshark humorously and menacingly played by james e moriarty and borrows grand to bet on a sure thing at freehold raceway the horse loses and now ray has big problems as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray he is undependable meanspirited and stupid so when his best friend mike gallagher the narrator of the film gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriendwho cares the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do as for rays gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen his buddies the college student mike and the dependable butchie gillan and his old man who he has this lovehate relationship with rally to his aid and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star because of his intensity and looks he reminds me of sean penn ',?
'it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others myself included would pick seven days in may both those films were tense exercises in chills the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man john frankenheimer but that was and respectively for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay the thrills all came from the plot ronin is like a film made by another man somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot but we see only tiny pieces of it we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j d zeiks screenplay is a bit obscure the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death he becomes a ronin much like a gunfighter in the american west if you miss the opening do not worry this film will explain again what a ronin is sam played by robert de niro is the modern equivalent of a ronin he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre natascha mcelhone of the truman show an irish woman to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case dierdre is very tightlipped about what is in the case sam joins a team of four others vincent jean reno of the professionalleon and mission impossible spence sean bean tvs richard sharpe and also patriot games and goldeneye and gregor stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting also along is larry skipp suddeth the group seems to know their business particularly sam but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team the story is not very easy to follow it is never clear who is doublecrossing whom and who is working for whom somehow russians who may or may not be the russian mafia and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case some very good actors are involved in this film one wonders what they saw in the script the characters are mostly onedimensional professional killers they know their work and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts since these are not very demanding characters to create in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the s i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy unfortunately there are no deep characters and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it i rate ronin a on the to scale and a on the to scale nonspoiler incidentally the tale of the ronin has been filmed multiple times usually under the title chushingura or as the ronin also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet this is the first blow of the ronin ',?
' snake eyes is the most aggravating kind of movie the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing its not just because this is a brian depalma film and since hes a great director and one whos films are always greeted with at least some fanfare and its not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance this film is hardly worth his talents its worse than that its aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more could be totally intelligent and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of halfassedness or more deservedly the hall of fame of the eighthassedness in certain circles snake eyes was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawas rashomon where a crime is told from the four different and i mean different perspectives and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening which i might add is superb in one very very very long steadicam shot we meet the protagonist crooked atlantic city detective rick santoro cage and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife interupts a payperview event on tv chases down a gambler enters the arena all pumped up for the fight sits down and talks with his bud kevin dunne gary sinise whos character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn whos also in this and watches as it happens theres a big name in the crowd and thats the secretary of defense charles kirkland joel fabiani whos sitting behind rick and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw is knocked out this all happens in the opening shot and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction what really happened this film asks and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene and discovers theres a very good possibility it was a conspiracy as we follow rick trying to learn of more information we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot carla gugino and who flees the scene in a panic and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casinohotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness takes on what happened this is all going pretty fine and dandy and its extremely interesting to watch then it takes one wrong step we follow the wrong character and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on and way before rick can find it out but thats not the worst part of it its that its the one person you didnt think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring the one you didnt think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it it only gets worse the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film and since we already know what happened we cant rely on ricks investigation to be all that interesting its as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in and decided to just fall back on an easy way out and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible events become more and more proposterous and by the end the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this the deux ex machina thats where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay this time its a hurricane an outofcontrol police car and a big round ball that adorned the arena what went wrong depalma and the screenwriter david koepp are extremely credible people in their respective fields and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this depalma who idolizes hitchcock to death has done many a film like this such as his masterpiece blow out where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece but granted depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch what with his overthetop shot setups notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel forgetting anything about boundaries at least his direction makes up partly for it then theres koepp who showed such great ability at making a characters flaws come to life like he did in depalmas earlier carlitos way a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well he can write a flawed character but his rick santoro seems to be just a halfassed effort hes flawed and we can see redemption if the story wasnt so formulaic a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup he may as well have said the opposite of what he says it would have at least gone with what the character was like this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way as i was watching the first half hour i couldnt wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed how many different perspectives hed be given and perhaps hed have to make a choice between whos he has to believe now theres a film unfortunately the film has two major deux ex machinas one in the disasterous ending the other about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap weve seen all too much before but never from someone like depalma ',?

'poster boy for codependency needs patching patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright by michael redman mediocrity is a pox on civilization in our heavily consumer oriented society there is an enormous demand to churn out stuff what would happen to our economy if we didnt feel the need to have more things to make us buy more businesses need to produce a ton of product the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality the film industry is like any other in order for studios to survive they have to make money the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that less talented people are used there arent enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary for some reason its never crossed anyones mind that the real equation is quality films more profit often mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies im not suggesting that patch adams was tossed out just to rake in the bucks my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story but its as dull as could be hunter patch adams robin williams desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around patch could be a poster boy for codependency he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesnt focus on his own problems he decides that he wants to be a physician leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia as a med student patchs antics at the schools hospital catch the attention of his soon to be archenemy straightlaced dean walcott bob gunton the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although hes one of the top students he writes in patchs academic file that he shows excessive happiness i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies then it struck me it must be based on a true story the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute a free clinic robin williams is an amazing actor while he is adept at dramatic roles his forte is overthetop free spirits thats what makes his failure here so remarkable patch is exactly the character he should be best at yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat something holds him back most of the rest of the cast is twodimensional for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings its curious that the ones here are cardboard characters peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person unfortunately hes in the film for only about two minutes the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene were not left to our own emotional decisions were hit over the head with them shavedheaded children with cancer an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh a beautiful woman who cant love because of her abusive history when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy hey lets put on a play we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains mode they laugh and roll around while painting each other there might as well be giant signs flashing feel good now feel bad now patch is a good title for the film it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of the fulloflife student fights stodgy establishment types theres a touching death then theres another the film doesnt trust us to get it the first time the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again worst of all is the final courtroom bit scarylooking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people the room is packed with patchs supporters williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all it has as much emotion as his earlier statement humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species contains truth most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk shadyac also directed the first ace ventura movie oedekerk directed the second one need i say more the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care the doctors are not gods theme will resonate with a number of people but its so poorly produced that no one will care ',?

'some movies i should just skip my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back and here comes another disney effectsfilled liveaction flick based on an old tv program true the probgram is only years old this time and its a cartoon but its a cartoon i liked and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen but my daughter really wanted to go and how bad could it be turns out i was right mostly inspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian down to the jivetalking sidekick at first i thought it was done by the same people but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it where formula isnt just business its a way of life the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits in some parts you can just hear them saying more zany i want more zany here and here lets have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here make it really painful i want the audience squirming in their seats ok thats fine but i want you to add bug guts what does this scene do character depth but wheres the zaniness i dont see zany here if you cant make it zany cut it the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie michelle who plays penny gadgets niece shines in every scene shes in but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor dabney colemans comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film but instead he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the gidget bitch from hell town mayor oteris overly enthusiastic and continually selfcongratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland oregons own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasnt poking fun at our fair town or maybe all career politicians are like that i must say matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla he appears to have some fun with the film especially as the evil gadget rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film d l hughley plays the shuckinandjivin vehicular sidekick in a role that firmly sets emancipation back years the dialog is lets face it its pretty bad the tagline after a major setpiece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context a lot of the lines especially hughleys appear to be made up as they go along by people with little gift for adlib about threequarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations not really battles with the evil gadget penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon let me rage here just for a minute michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character shes utterly charming and has excellent experience harriet the spy for the part of the pintsize detective why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting or editing stupidity inspector gadget is missing the long long stretches of potty humor that among other things made my favorite martian so unbearable but its a very short movie so perhaps something was cut at the last moment probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits the evil sidekick support group is especially worth seeing and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds its onscreen all in all another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films i wonder if disney uses the revenues for its generally moneymaking cartoons to produce these losers but if true why if theyre trying for another mary poppins they need to find a team that can produce one and then give them a chance to do it ',?
'are you like me do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places shouting out loud not giving a ratts ass about anyone around them and basically just wallowing in their own selfimportance well if you are than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half only to make up and hug in the end aaaaaaaahhhh plot three grownup sisters living their own separate lives begin to reestablish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill critique this would be a good movie if it wasnt for the fact that its got very little to say features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any thirdrate afterschool special and im being nice how junk like this gets made is beyond me but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryans character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot wow how deep of course the same christmas tune thats played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background while characters continue to build bonds among one another by making reference to old quaint movies or movie stars stop me im gonna cry again this film is a mess the characters are boring and irritating to watch the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot kind of liking their father but not really and then finally realizing the error of their ways while sharing an emotional moment about movie stars from the s admittedly i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot looking as adorable as ever but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movietv show that shes in enough already and diane keaton mustve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one cause her acting was amateurish at best neither one convinced in emotional scenes granted they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and thats probably where my rating of three points comes from all in all this movie is not funny unless youre one to chuckle at train wrecks provides zero drama unless you consider loud phone conversations moving generates absolutely no emotion although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine and ends on a perfectly pretentious note oh no please dont get any flour on my donna karan dress ugh i suggest that all ladies take their husbandsboyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something thatll teach em to mess with you oh and incidentally mrs joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind so there then again maybe youll like it ',?
'suicide is pointless everyone should know that so whats this movie like you guessed it pointless the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever thats what the press materials for the film probably say now heres what i say the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time boring arty pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as well as committing suicide the movie lost me early on immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window the girls father james woods holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on then as the scene ends the lawn sprinklers come on is that a joke is that supposed to be amusing in some way from then on the movie failed to draw me back in performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well dunst has the potential to be a big star if she chooses her projects well and while this film is awful she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed there are also a few cameos in the film here and there which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more as a result they all seem rather pointless although theres a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since well since eddie and the cruisers perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what theyre feeling all we really know is that mrs lisbon kathleen turner is strict and keeps them on a short leash what mother doesnt its certainly no reason to commit suicide with the godfather part iii sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera with the virgin suicides she proves she has no business behind it either having family connections doesnt entitle you to be allowed to make movies so attention film directors stop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry just because they share your dna doesnt mean they share your talent r ',?

'a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous th century french poets the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities the result is merely an academic exercise leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldnt build on to show them as the poets they were on paper this shouldnt have been so terrible it had a talented director in agnieszka holland the secret garden a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton dangerous liaisons and a capable cast but the film was done in by its inept script the unappealing way the film was directed and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade he especially looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be but when the two of them were together it looked like a mismatch leonardos rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude yet we know from rimbauds poetry that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring the film opens in postrevolutionary france in the yearold rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems he accepts verlaines praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville once there rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household has an immediate conflict with verlaines busty yearold wife mathilde romane and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her familys money even though he has nothing else in common with her when verlaine states poets can learn from one another rimbaud replies in a haughty tone only if theyre bad poets he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship verlaine proves to be weakwilled beating his wife regularly and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud when mathildes father kicks rimbaud out of the house verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers its a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce in brussels verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gunrunner and after ten years there comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying the film ends on a whimper with verlaine talking with rimbauds sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published this film was especially annoying because rimbauds poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film but whatever it was it just didnt work it certainly didnt bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the socalled father of modern poetry ',?

'mr nice guy is the latest jackie chan film so you should know what to expect a weak plot terrible dialogue very little acting ability but some jawdropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile however mr nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackies best efforts and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever jackie chan plays who else jackie this time out hes a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show not that it ever makes a difference in the plot there are only two scenes of him cooking for the rest of the film somehow he mutates into jackie chan supercop it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills perhaps he was in the same cooking as steven seagal in under siege a tv newswoman diana gabrielle fitzpatrick covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo richard norton and a local gang of toughs the demons although she only has one camcorder somehow the result is full of closeups and multiple angles hmmm shades of broadcast news anyway the goons discover diana and will do anything to recover the tape here lies another crucial flaw in the story doesnt anyone realize you can copy a tape oh well no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense as luck would have it diana runs across jackie and wouldnt you know it jackie accidentally ends up with the tape this leads to countless chase andor fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie in a move apparently designed to woo american and other englishspeaking audiences the film uses english as its primary language however that doesnt mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackies recent americanized releases strangely many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english and poorly too whether this is just a very bad case of looping an effort to minimize accents or a simple case of nostalgia it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackies dubbed films the plot in mr nice guy is negligible merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackies films it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread look if you have jackie chan playing a chef why not use that to your advantage watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts the action is a mixed bag here theres really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackies films it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan the action in the film is neither jackies best nor worst but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes the films gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting once or twice it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence but to slomo jackie running either this is a nod to the sixmillion dollar man or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down if youve seen all of jackies films and are in need of another fix go ahead and see mr nice guy however if youre just in the mood for some good action youd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work such as supercop ',?
'salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets actors who demand such salaries might be greedy but in some instances they are quite justified because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation proof for that can be found even in the realm of lowbudget movies and one fine example is breakaway thriller directed by sean dash and starring in famous figure skater tonya harding face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movies poster but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster one day she decides to retire but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that realising that her life suddenly became worthless myra starts running for her life followed by professional assassins terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities her acting leaves much to be desired on the other hand her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave bfilms a bad name martin sheens brother joe estevez whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set is the only bright spot of breakaway unfortunately he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya hardings silver screen debut proved to be her last film ',?

'years ago robin williams made jumanji a brilliant achievement in special effects but a travesty on nearly every other level the same can be said for what dreams may come a boring illogical weepiewannabe that left my senses numb dont get me wrong i love breathtaking special effects and pulsepounding imagery brazil is on my personal top ten the city of lost children is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios i even love and last year at marienbad being in the minority amidst my friends what dreams may come imagery aside has little daring thought to complement its imagery the daring thought it does have is never fully realized its idea of a plot is so lukewarm that it insults the bigger questions it raises it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences put on an electronica soundtrack and sell it as one of those popular minds eye videos robin williams plays chris nielsen who dies too prematurelynot only in the story but before we have a chance to really know and care for him the director vincent ward and the screenwriter ronald bass have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife big mistake it would have been far better to take the halfhour or so needed to tell his life story first ala its a wonderful life so that i can build up respect for him so i could know and possibly care for him his children and his longsuffering wife played superbly by annabella sciorra instead the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses it doesnt so in the afterlife chris learns that a people still dont meet god b that our thoughts are reality and c time does not exist there hmm ill grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative the not meeting god part still irks at me but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect that said this alternate reality still makes no possible sense read on chris wife commits suicide since suicides go to hell chris would be separated from his wife forever the important question is is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love good question and i like good thoughtprovoking questions i dont like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question i loathe it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously i really loathe it when its story is no longer run by logic but by special effects hey chris did you forget your thoughts are real they are more real than the physical world according to the newage screenplay so why dont you conjure up positive thoughts of annie and let that run wild and then she would appear before you and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity because there would be no movie thats why and albert the angel played by miscast cuba gooding jr says bluntly thats fantasy umm if your thoughts are more real than the physical then fantasy is not fantasy but real surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person and that your thoughts arent big enough to sustain you for eternity well in all due respect thats why i dont subscribe to this theology all due respect another idea based on time pause does not exist here so chris spend your eternity with annie as she is on earth reliving your favorite memories or hang out with her when she was growing up youve got eternity perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out and forcing her to write i still exist in her diary imo is just too tacky there are many other ideas all of which are a hundred times better than whats unraveled in the plot the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before and just come out stale most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris life appear in heaven differently than he expects so when they finally show themselves he realizes they were with him all along and when this happens the film runs in slow motion as if to build emotion gag me with a spoon so the only things for me to like are sciorras effective performance who rises far above this mundane material and the special effects please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals i did not enjoy all of them some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe everybody floating up and down in invisible strings it sounds like a joke but its really true i really tried to block out the dialogue and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack my vote goes to a rare cd called never say die from petra a christian rock group its pretty good and they have a song about annie who commits suicide its too late for annieshes gone away for goodtheres so much wed have told herand now we wish we couldbut its too late melancholic yes depressing yes but far more entertaining so in case you dont know let me be straight suicidebad dont do it no no no got it you shouldnt have to pay to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest ',?

'a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city the lawyer kevin lomax keanu reeves is not offered a job yet he is asked to simply pick a jury he accepts the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money but a gorgeous apartment he convinces his wife mary ann charlize theron to make the move to new york the first case given to him is a big test a winless case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal his new boss and partner in the firm john milton al pacino is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing explaining many of his philosophies on law women and sex and angles the promise of a blissful wealthy life kevins next case is a dream case given to him by milton himself much to the chagrin to his colleagues defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law although kevins career is taking off his home life is not doing very well mary ann is starting to have numerous problems she is experiencing severe depression over kevins long hours and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls their faces becoming horribly disfigured kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with then focus all of his attention on his wife not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer connie nielson also working with the firm mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife and gets disturbing news from his mother judith ivey about the mystery concerning the identity of his father he also starts to lose control of his case kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man that man is his boss mr milton a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store but how do you defeat the devil why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd do filmmakers really believe that normal courtroom drama doesnt fit the bill and they have to juice them up the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom which wouldnt have been too bad if it werent keanu reeves trying to pull it off i give reeves credit for trying hard but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short charlize theron defines the term overthetop in her performance as mary ann lomax a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in days in the valley the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil and you can tell he is having fun doing so but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him its pretty standard stuff including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled but i have to get something off of my chest in i remember watching a movie called wisdom with emilio estevez and demi moore and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do what i like to call guess what it was all a dream scenario in wisdom the two lead characters are killed at the end only to have one of the characters wake up from an apparent and say gosh im glad that didnt really happen i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with well the same thing happens in the devils advocate and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan since it failed and he is the devil but the point is that the last of the film didnt happen i know its a stretch after all it is a movie and nothing really happened but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that of course the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one as i recall wisdom was a decent film the devils advocate is not the devils advocate directed by taylor hackford john milton al pacino kevin lomax keanu reeves mary ann lomax charlize theron mrs lomax judith ivey eddie barzoon jeffrey jones christabella connie nielson written by randy turgeon march ',?

'note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned quick robin the antishark repellant adam west in the batman feature film casually kicking at a patheticlooking rubber shark attached to his leg i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness but in many instances batman and robin nears and at some point even exceeds this standard this is a disasterously bad film easily the worst in the series to date and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive its loud garish and obnoxious with pointless gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill batman and robin features the caped crusaders george clooney debuting as batman with chris odonnell returing as robin squaring off against another bevy of chemicallyinduced villains the nefarious icecold mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights and the slinky poison ivy uma thurman who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result but whatever and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss by ivys side is the giant steroid monster bane jeep swanson a grunting hulk of a beast the villains goals are noble ones freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife vendela dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation and ivys intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth albeit by destroying all human life meanwhile on the homefront life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth michael gough and the arrival of his niece barbara alicia silverstone akiva goldsmans screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad with astonishingly terrible dialogue lame jokes and an awful bythenumber plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement it makes goldsmans screenplay of batman forever which i thought was dreadful look positively inspired in comparison i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which id seen used in no joke an episode of gilligans island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production joel schumachers direction of batman and robin is horrific with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film even moreso than with his previous batman forever with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo just in case i suppose if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin and with neon prominently figuring in an utterlypointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivys chosen new abode another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving latenight motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons mr schumachers focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible to the detriment of the story there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between allout camp and heartfelt drama with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the films opening even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered is batman and robin supposed to be campy i think it is its hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted bomb each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be i somehow doubt it the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isnt attempting to be the utter farce which it is arnold schwarzenegger is topbilled in the film as the villainous mr freeze and is bland and uninteresting perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be mr schwarzeneggers attempts to be menacing are laughable and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable frankly everything he does onscreen is laughable by the end of the film i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen the bulk of his performance consists of uttering nearunintelligble puns and oneliners featuring every possible permutation of cool in the least inventive way george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin being overshadowed by the villains and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film his batman is hardly an imposing figure chris odonnell is unimpressive in a onenote performance while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all the films one saving grace undoubtably uma thurmans entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy her work in batman and robin is certainly overthetop but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film ms thurmans comic timing is impeccable and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully im already starting to positively reassess jim carreys performance in batman forever her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film and when shes offscreen the film greatly suffers i figure that if one has to die being kissed to death by uma thurman isnt a halfbad way to go while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulsepounding excitement i must admit that i was not bored watching it although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or oneliner and by awaiting yet

' my name is jack carter and you dont want to know me says our brooding antihero sylvester stallone take his advice to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace and to watch this film is almost as painful get carter is a gloomy looking unimaginative film that offers no joy jack carter is as tough as tough guys come he works out of vegas as a selfdescribed financial adjuster explaining his duties he says people make promises and break them i help them remember he has a chiseled body full of tattoos he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice in other words this is sylvester stallone acting like sylvester stallone and like most of his previous roles his character is a shallow onedimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough hassle a few hapless people find out what he needs to know and then dispense his own kind of justice with the charisma of a pit bull being tough is all that jack carter knows yet even tough guys know when to put family first as the story begins we learn that jacks little brother has died in a car accident the police attribute it to heavy drinking however jack is suspicious believing that he was taken out he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth as he pokes around he runs into several lowlife characters they include a shady business partner a prostitute a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates and an oily owner of a porn website any one of them may know something about his brothers death all of them have the means of carrying out the deed but dont expect an exercise in sleuthing where wellplaced clues lead carter to the truth hes all brawn and no brains so there are no epiphanies during his investigation instead he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward cycling through this circle of suspects flustered with his lack of progress he cycles through them again and again this all gets tiring fairly quickly by the time the film launches into its final act were numb from its pedestrian pace oddly as a toughguy thriller it starves us for action admittedly there is one nifty chase sequence but this is related to a tangential and needless plot carters vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion stallone has the personality of a slab of stone and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast the weather is constantly overcast or rainy meanwhile most shots take place at night in dimly lit rooms or in dark alleys its just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere as a result get carter amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement youre better off leaving this guy alone ',?
'well heres a distasteful thoroughly amateurish item that surprisingly was actually a boxoffice hit at the time of its release after just viewing the film for the first time my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of enjoy this movie it is cheap idiotic unfunny and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was at least some smut would have livened things up a bit porkys tells the story if you can call it that of four clueless high school buddies pee wee dan monahan billy mark herrier tommy wyatt knight and mickey roger wilson whom desperately want to get laid women for the most part are a mystery to them and in this movie they are to the audience as well since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet their plan is sidetracked however when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porkys which they are able to get into using fake ids after they pay the manager onehundred bucks for three hookers they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building for these four teenage guys this means war on porkys porkys ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level as a teenage sexromp it is not wild or amusing enough as a comedy all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat as a look back at the s it is something i suspect most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave and as a revenge movie it is a crushing bore one of the most offensive things about porkys is how jawdroppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters and we learn very little about them except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool that sure is revealing information the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark the women are all treated as objects or comedy props rather than real people for example the two gym teachers mrs balbricker nancy parsons and honeywell kim cattrall only have one purpose and that is to be made fun of mrs balbricker is a gruff noholdsbarred overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness and in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses even though i have the suspicion they are not but one thing is for sure they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny only humiliating to prove how outoftouch this socalled comedy is compare it to other more serious s films about teenagers and it looks even worse in comaprison any of the john hughes pictures such as s sixteen candles or s the breakfast club put porkys at an even greater shame those films actually dealt with serious teen matters but remained a great deal funnier thanks to their bright and truthful writing and heck if porkys wanted to be a teenage sex movie id take s fast times at ridgemont high or s the last american virgin over this any day of the week director bob clark is not a bad director two years after he made porkys he directed the nostalgic holiday a christmas story i would forgive him for this misfire in fact if it wasnt for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in porkys ',?
'its a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it such is the case for the paul mayersberg film the last samurai though the blurb alludes to a jungle filled with political intrigue uneasy alliances and murderous enemies at every turn the story of the movie is actually quite simple and prosaic a middleaged japanese businessman named endo played by john fujioka and his assistant both of whom have samurai aspirations travel to africa in search of his ancestor who went to bring buddhism to africa he hires the services of downattheheels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo the redoubtable lance henriksen and his girlfriend arabella holzbog and travels to the camp of an armsmerchantcumsafarihost cumislamicmissionary john saxon and his wife lisa eilbacher they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witchdoctor aspirations to conceal a prearranged arms deal which subsequently falls through congo escapes finds endos ancestors sword and comes back guns blazing to free the rest of them and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword the end the last samurai is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable it is merely there the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated subplots that are never explained and many scenes that make very little sense at all the film is shot through with all the tired old inscrutable japanese samurai and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie it is quite slowpaced with only a bit of action near the end and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic most of the acting is fair with the possible exception of congos girlfriend lance henriksen is his usual scenechewing self and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery i paid for this film from the discount rack at best buy and halfway suspect i overpaid for it if you are in the mood for samurai read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie skip the last samurai unless you are a diehard henriksen fan ',?

'watching the movie i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup cute n cuddly computergenerated monkey if the monkey died the movie got an extra half star alas the monkey showed up at the end unharmed to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs what that means is that lost in space actually deserved stars thats pretty generous considering the movies camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek when will robinson jack johnson teaches his pet robot about friendship you are actually supposed to buy it so why such a seemingly high rating there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage first we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater the sound and screen kicked ass nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did and i dont necessarily mean that in a good way also there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons or getting caught up in the movies tension i even liked the computergenerated settings i usually prefer to see models or sets but the cg was more detailed than ive seen in a lot of movies it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities also gary oldman is never a bad actor even though he is typecast as a villain william hurt isnt too bad either neither actor had a great role but their performances were watchable and perhaps i shouldnt admit this but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood there is very little swearing or blood there is a strong moral message saccharine though it is there is a bit of romance whose culmination after hours is a real kiss no sex it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six those movies were probably as bad as lost in space but at the time they were manna from heaven that type of moviemaking is a lost art now for the bad news worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue its squeakyclean family fun trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction you better hold on to your joystick is one such line and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign second worst and closely related is the screenplay the storys exposition takes place at a press conference which allows the writers to explain whats happening with the least amount of creativity effort or interest once the story gets going i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while but on the whole the situations that arise are silly and contrived when gary oldman easily reprograms wills pet robot to kill the robinsons my friend summed it up perfectly he flipped the switch to evil then theres the tone of the movie the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson then it could be an adventure movie theyre mostly right except that johnson will wasnt a good enough actor to carry it off still that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesnt mean that we have to bow to a promise keepers notion of whos the center of a family many quality family films have been made with a nontraditional family structure fly away home comes to mind to much better effect and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie in star wars the rebels were the good guys we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system in lost in space the rebels are the bad guys a terrorist force that must be killed crushed and silenced so that our children may live free that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists finally a few specific details deserve criticism the movie tells us that the setting is the year why why bother saying what year this is just tell us its the future i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it wont be timeless not that this movie was really in the running anyway then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunnys barber chair and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers havent learned a thing about ergonomics one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed it made lost in space look cool the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and out of context made it sound hip this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie but if thats the best part of the movie i cant in good conscience recommend it still if you get stuck seeing it as we did you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance think of liking bad movies as a child and bring along your bad movie bingo cards

should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career what doesnt make sense is how such highprofile and superb actors as john travolta robert duvall william h macy and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project which is both dull and completely ineffective the film which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia certainly contains the type of story to be emotionallycharged but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings leaving us with nothing more than a poorlydone courtroom drama based on a book by jonathan hart which was consequently based on a true account a civil action is set in in the town of woburn mass where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann john travolta decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their childrens death from leukemia due to unknown causes jan originally decides to drop the case but when he stumbles across to corporate giants grace and beatrice foods who have plants located near the families homes he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which thus goes into the citys drinking water suddenly after hearing about the families heartbreak and personal stories he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery even though he is warned by his staff accountant william h macy that no money is coming in to them only going out also figuring into the story is jerome facher robert duvall beatrice foods corporate counsel who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his million offer to settle the case coming from such a talented writer director and cast not to mention one of the most interesting film composers danny elfman a civil action is an astoundingly emptyheaded drama one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning watching the film i couldnt help but notice its similarities with s far far superior film the sweet hereafter which dealt with a lawyer played brilliantly by ian holm investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident holm interviews the grieving parents as well as the sole surviving passenger a teenage girl which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter a young drugaddict who has run away from home not only was the plotting similar to a civil action but it also had the same exact running time of minutes considering this it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful a sweet hereafter was not only concentrating on the school bus accident but delving deeply into ian holms character and his own personal demons as well as the teenage girl in a civil action however i have no idea where the running time went since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness we do not get to know the parents very well nor any of the main characters through its whole duration i did not learn one thingnot one thingabout travoltas lawyer character jan schlictmann who doesnt appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job every scene is tediously related directly to the premise and therefore there was no one for me to care about or root for youve got to work pretty hard actually to not get an audience to become involved in the parents plight since their children are dead but that is exactly what a civil action does to be honest i would be fairly hardpressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked aside from one flashback to when a mans young son died on the way to the doctor i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes and more than once found my mind wandering i could say the performances were good but whos fooling who since every character is onedimensionally written no ones acting abilities are challenged in any way travolta plays a lawyer well enough but thats about all he does duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role apparently only appearing to give oneliners at every chance he gets and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the pictures final scene as a judge she appears unbilled since it is just a cameo but why did she even agree to do it in the first place finally when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role the film left me with another question what was the point abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum where none came before that to begin with a civil action seemed to me at least to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with

'movies dont come much more ridiculously titled than i still know what you did last summer but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous the title sort of works as a warning more than a sillysounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor this horror sequels moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot what you did last summer you actually did the summer before last summer and since i knew about it this summer as well as last summer its really illogical to say that i still know what you did last summer the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter i still know the longer i still know what you did two summers ago or the appropriate stupid people getting hacked to bits that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart for example if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress probably not but thats precisely what college student karla pop diva brandy does to best friend julie jennifer love hewitt resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights julie youll recall was one of the sole survivors at the end of s surprise hit i know what you did last summer after a slasher with a grudge to bear its a long story began trying to pick off her her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village in this installment the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas and julie yet racked by guilt decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind yeah right their island paradise has room of course for one more in the form of the stillalive killer muse watson from the first film he sports the same gortons fisherman getup a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity but why hes still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves though i suppose his hookhand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit in a sense thats the movies glaring flaw everybody knows who the bad guy is thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel the murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary but trey callaways derivative i still know screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all what does he do he twistties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays youd think hed want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later even prequel summer lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neato shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh the innovative gallows humor that scribe and scream wunderkind kevin williamson injected into i know s unfolding story is sorely missed replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like yo youll cheer not shriek when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest if i know what you did last summer however effective was just the kind of movie that those subversive scream flicks poked fun at then the deadly i still know what you did last summer deserves a fullblown roasting on mystery science theatre ',?
'another formula feel good quirky comedy from the british isles much like waking ned devine and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town such as tolerant vicars and policemen plenty of eccentrics and of locals who stick together through thick and thin the strength of this film lies in its rational theme that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol the film is tolerable until after its first hour it then falls completely apart becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to at least be viewed as containing a pertinent message its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the war on drugs is about to be escalated into colombia the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future it has so far just ended up causing americas jails to be overcrowded with nonviolent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing americas drug usage and drug supply billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war by backing a corrupt government remember vietnam with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam with this scenario closer to home so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war the films mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public something that should have been accepted some years ago is a theme long overdue for public acceptance but one that is better received late than never there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this rather than making it a police matter altogether the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middleaged woman grace brenda blethyn who fell out of an airplane evidently committing suicide the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up without her knowledge their comfortable year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husbands enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london honey quick what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying is that when conferring with honey she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can the creditors swoop down on her like vultures her gardener and handyman matthew ferguson decides to stay on with her despite his last check bouncing since she is an expert amateur horticulturist he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants which he grows for private use the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be highquality stuff for grace this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt for the scotsman matthew it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky valerie the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed the police sergeant campbell pretends not to notice what the bright lights in graces greenhouse is for the friendly vicar phillips counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you cant control and the doctor clunes enjoys smoking the weed for recreation the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a bigtime drug dealer instead of having matthew go because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesnt want matthew to end up in jail it is interesting to note that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you only that one can go to jail the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london trying to find a drug dealer while dressed out of place in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole whereby it never recovered its dignity the film moves into the formula mode whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive as she meets an international drug dealer a frenchman tcheky karyo who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences thereby becoming a celebrity things work out in a ridiculous way where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded this unhip film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly but should be tolerated as something naughty middleaged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute ummm ',?
' you cant have any of this its all mine a twisted priest charles huevelman hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana angela zimmerly looks on uninterested an evil presence appropriately named the presence dj vivona rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him for kicks the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered when something goes wrong and one of the presences recent victims escapes the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped they enlist the help of alison ramona midgett a recent suicide victim to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the netherrealm her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed the kings sorcerer amblyn who also lost his job decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice during the downtime in his unemployment amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery evil and torture ruled abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love in this new realm amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm after each murder abraham would become stronger until his power surpassed that of amblyns because of the screwup that allowed the recent escape abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered if theres one thing i cant stand when i see a film its when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this and now ice from the sun can be added to this list this film is essentially an minute stalkandslash film following the dantes inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street through intercut with almost minutes of strange and supposedly haunting images many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot if there arent bizarre images floating past the screen then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone compelling but ultimately not the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesnt pop up until near the end of the sequence when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv had found its way to my tv at least the music in the film is pretty decent made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing for some reason though he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance one overalled cretin handles the presences gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel then theres an inbred father dwight spurgin and his two inbred children mark kettler and jennifer poirrierwallace that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half doghalf human mix with a shotgun and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of rednecks when you yourself had all of these cool powers and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned draggingsalting sequence the character in question dana angela zimmely has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever when she starts to leave the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life walks out and makes like it wants to be crucified by her the presence starts to clap annoyingly which continues for the rest of the sequence until dana takes off with the strange creature following her when it finally catches up to her she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ the box for the film claims because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of contains nudity and graphic violence while both is certainly true there doesnt seem to be much of either in any large amounts besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump a semigraphic selfsurgery scene and two instances of head trauma one run over and one melting most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety as for nudity it is very sparse but at least we get to see angela zimmerly far and away the most attractive cast member before her body is bruised torn and bloodied by the dragging incident ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www bmovie com it has been presented in in fullframe only and the transfer for a film shot a good deal in mm is pretty decent besides the decent soundtrack which is also available from www bmovie com a makingof video is also available called on thin ice i havent had the opportunity to see the documentary but i

'i never understood what the clich hell on earth truly meant until very recently ive just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying so horrible so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as hell on earth after all ive never been to war ive never been the victim of any violent crime ive never really been broken hearted and ive never been audited so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was hell on earth then i saw cruel intentions in a perfect world i would be in charge of all the movie studios the very first thing id do in this perfect world would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv and throw them in jail but it wouldnt just be your average jail not even a maximum security installation id have these producers and everyone else involved in the production of these films put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity now youre probably thinking to yourself is this really how bad cruel intentions is the answer is no its actually much worse watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumbles awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound and then pouring acid on the salt i dont know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum tara reid whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom from that opening scene where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz to the conclusion which i dont remember because i had practically fallen asleep cruel intentions is truly hell on earth right up there with war and tax audits ',?

'synopsis a humorless police officers life changes when he befriends a supersmart superadorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute young blond scientist unfortunately einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfootsized apecreature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine and this rogainenightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl meanwhile a group of white chainsmoking guntoting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie comments watchers reborn a cheaply made directtovideo turkey is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontzs bestselling novel watchers technically this should have been called watchers v but it seems that this cycle of horror movies much like many other sequelcrazy film series has decided to drop the numbers from the titles even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago this really isnt a good movie have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation well any hope a viewer may have had perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill will be dashed by the time hes seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn theyre awful these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer some weird crap about a dead indian teens and wolves and an action movie called detonator starring scott baio scott baio what idiot dreamed this movie up after surviving these abysmal trailers the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented watchers reborn maybe it wont be that bad he may say to himself perhaps just perhaps the bottomofthebarrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading watchers reborn after all is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago it stars mark hamill luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy lou rawls is even in the mix unfortunately the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill he looks very sick here and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers the book the latter is really too bad koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good but he is still my favorite hack writer koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful people who read many of his books however often complain of repetitive plot devices its definately not a koontz book if there isnt a psychic a superintelligent dog or a psychotic killer who likes ripping out peoples eyeballs watchers has all three devices which may explain why its arguably the most popular of koontzs books the idea behind koontzs novel though highly implausible is very interesting basically a biological war machine is created a smart dog can be released in battle track down its target and then relay the targets position psychically to a large creature designed to kill in handtohand combat silly but kind of neat too im sorry i dont mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn the movie i suppose i just dont want to talk about the movie itself this turkey is really cheesy no one in this movie can act including mark hamill and its difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero the cheese factor is only increased when hes involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist geneticist zoologist whateverthef kshessupposedtobe whom he befriends mercifully the filmmakers opted not to do nudity to be honest the only halfconvincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie and the creature yes the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling this creature is shot about times but its okay the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing oh he can also rip body parts off allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around cheesy gore thats another main element of watchers reborn it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the films campiness rather than its suspense ultimately i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror scifi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the films silliness though this film will tax even their patience its an minute film but it feels like four hours also i hate to admit i have survived far worse than this anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin fear the rush will know what i mean finally i couldnt help but think that watchers reborn would work well as bot fodder for the creative folks behind one of my alltime favorite shows mystery science theater this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face rated r watchers reborn contains dozens of bloodspattered bodies and unconvincing gore it also has violence obviously i wouldnt recommend it for the little kids but im sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay instead of watching this film however i recommend reading koontzs book trust me itll be time much much better spent ',?
'capsule the much anticipated readaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting but very little intelligence visually there is much to like about this version but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gullivers travels and treat it as an action film that makes it a film without much center to pierre boulle author of the bridge on the river kwai wrote planet of the apes a k a monkey planet the novel as a social satire it reads a lot like a fifth book of gullivers travels humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swifts island of the houyhnhnms the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals but perhaps i was just looking for that when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in he added a number of serling touches familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serlingish the final irony of the original version has become film history without it there could never have been a planet of the apes film series i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language that could have been done in the film but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the nonapespeaking serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and of course there is some justification for that by the end of the film justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending but serling never tackles the allimportant question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language a language they had no opportunity to ever hear few viewers questioned this serious plot hole however and the film has become well respected in cinema history partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmiths best if not his best when the films success called for sequels the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added wellintentioned though not very subtle political messages about what was happening in the united states of the s and s while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half hearted by the second film beneath the planet of the apes there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again for those who thought that the version was not very faithful to the book burtons new version is even less faithful first he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes he has them both be intelligent articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands uh make that paws of the apes that could be a good story too but it is not planet of the apes as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring in leo davidson mark wahlberg not this worlds most expressive actor works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizardofozfashion and drops him on an alien planet yes he survives this storm but then no storm is perfect he quickly finds not greatly to any surprise he shows that on this planet apes rule and humans drool but everybody talks and the language they talk is earth english apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didnt occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at humananimal relationships and more one of the masterslave relationships outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari played by helena bonham carter ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power she is bent on making the world a better place perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hilari in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes this is a further abandonment of the source material the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of eachs place in this reversed society each important in the book we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn this is a miscalculation as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win the script had little subtlety with lines like i never met an ape i didnt like but at least we cared for what happened to taylor the main character most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog this tends to limit close looks at the makeup in general it seems much improved from the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers who did it for the version in chambers makeup was a jawdropper it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion chambers is good but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker today audiences have higher expectations bakers visualization is really an improvement these visuals work nicely what does not work is the wire assisted leaps some of the apes make they look like they were inspired by the physics defying leaps of crouching tiger hidden dragon apes spring incredible distances some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people closeup since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy makeup the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti it is not that his lines are so good most are silly jokes but he delivers them very well he was always a watchable actor but has not yet made stardom as the apetrader limbo he overemotes to overcome his ape makeup but does it very well in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinovs performance in spartacus as an injoke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself danny elfmans score has a nice primitive feel but jerry goldsmiths tour de force score is a real that score and the whole film will be remembered when the film is forgotten i rate the remake on the to scale and a on the to scale ',?

'these days people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run s nostalgia is already wearing off and now people are becoming more and more interested in s few years in the future early s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia however i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoons loaded weapon that in many ways symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry lack of originality and ideas being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series this film pairs two l a policemen jack colt emilio estevez burnout alcoholic cop on the edge and wes luger samuel l jackson bythebook policeman days away from retirement two of them following the murder of lugers ex partner must confront evil general mortars william shatner crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies the authors of this films whose director gene quintano worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects and that reflects in the lack plot characters and even original lines the plot or what goes for the plot in this movie is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years apart from lethal weapon series this film borrows its female lead from basic instinct the best gags are same as with many other similar movies shown in the trailers the rest simply doesnt work only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh others would probably wince at the lameness of humour some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while but at the end spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon joke in their fourth sequel ',?
'synopsis cromagnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggystyle ayla grows up to become a blond feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate comments allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the scifi blade runner the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title not even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese its so uniquely bad a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries and miserably fails to be serious that its oddly fascinating the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud plays out the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m auel to this day the book possesses a loyal cult following i remember a dear friend of mine had a dogeared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the socalled dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother i have never read this book but i sure hope its times better than its film adaptation if not then im at a complete loss to explain its popularity the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene a young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in e t tramps about in the woods with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her the audiences expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up aylas mother a blonde with fur pants er leggings tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera well as the earthquake slowly recedes a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming sixyearold manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven i wont detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point this movie is really stupid it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief also the obvious comparison between the appearance of cromagnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston the movie doesnt just suggest this message it whacks the message into the audience with a twobyfour a blond gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs shes of the new people theyre of the old people with the memories yep we get it we get it the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best makeup which surprises me the movie depends upon a lot of makeup obviously but much of it is unconvincing as stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time the rest of the characters have dark makeup of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt the facepainting thats occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind this movie also suffers from its new age trappings maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during but now it sounds dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music add to this the films fauxmysticism including spirit animals and dream visions and a narrator who sounds like a psychic youd expect to hear on a number and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious the clan of the cave bear is rated r though its probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films ive seen in quite a while it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about although this may sound gratuitous im sure its so cheesy that it probably wont bother most people the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie however as i wrote at the beginning of this review it does have the distinction of originality typically when i think of bottomofthebarrel films dealing with early man fantasy movies involving dinosaurs who did not exist at the same time as man and raquel welch come to mind the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that though its so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie which is why i awarded this turkey two stars i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version however im only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie i shudder to think that it could be otherwise ',?

' jack frost is one of those dumb corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching this does not come as a surprise since the studio that made it is warner brothers who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other jack frost michael keaton is a struggling middleaged rock musician who loves his wife gabby kelly preston and yearold son charlie joseph cross but doesnt spend nearly enough time with them when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas halfway there jack has second thoughts but on his way back home is in a car accident and dies switch forward a year christmas is approaching once again and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jacks death when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died the snowman outside the house is taken over by jacks spirit jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise frosty the snowman is a cartoon and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated but as a liveaction film it doesnt work at all after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established jack frost quickly goes downhill especially once the snowman comes into play since jack has been deceased for a whole year you would think there would be many questions to ask him such as what happens after you die or how does it feel to be a snowman but instead the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie the performances are respectable enough but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this michael keaton at least got off easy since he disappears after the first twenty minutes but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here i have always liked kelly preston she is clearly a talented charismatic actress but has never been given a good role in her life usually having to settle for a onedimensional supporting character as in s nothing to lose and addicted to love joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent in one of the only subplots that actually works due to its wittiness henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side however by the triedandtrue main plot at hand which is the sappy story of a father and son since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid cringeinducing lines of dialogue some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father you da man says charlie no i da snowman replies jack or how about this little zinger coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out snowdad is better than no dad do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this the snowman created by john hensons creature shop is more believable than the snowman from last years unintentionally hilarious directtovideo horror flick also called jack frost but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects either way it was an awful lot of work to go through just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project as a seasonal holiday picture jack frost is pretty much a clunker a better christmas film from this year is ill be home for christmas better yet my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film such as its a wonderful life a christmas story or prancer jack frost is an earnest but severely misguided film and children as well as adults deserve better i doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent anyway ',?

' americas sweethearts has an intriguing premise and a great cast but it isnt nearly as edgy or funny as it should be almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to coscript writer billy crystal who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while cohosting comic relief charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg two other paragons of selfindulgence crystal ignores a simple but crucial rule for a screwball comedy to work the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous americas sweethearts takes place at a press junket where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters its a promising setup but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules thus dissipating the tension of the situation by the end of the film all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed john cusack and catherine zetajones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector hank azaria a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together six crossed the million mark but the prospects for their final effort a space opus titled time over time are far from rosy while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup gwens solo films have tanked to make matter worse the director of the movie christopher walken a visionary who purchased the unabombers cabin and had it moved to his backyard is withholding the film from the studio insisting that the first screening be held at the junket desperate to win over the press the studio elects to hire lee billy crystal a recently fired publicist to salvage the situation lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation he enlists the help of kiki julia roberts gwens sister personal assistant and whipping girl what lee doesnt know is that kiki is in love with eddie a fact that could temper her effectiveness press junkets are a haven for control freaks studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel with food and drink always at hand generally on the evening of their arrival writers are bussed to see the featured film then ferreted straight back to the hotel the next day writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews every minutes or so a producer director writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression writers are free to ask what they want but understand that if the studio dislikes a question they may not be invited to future junkets representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew with the studio filming the exchanges the reporters are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars but to play it safe the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired but the screenplay undermines the conceit the junket is moved from the handsome but highly confining four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas for most of the film the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds completely safe from the eyes of the press when they do deal with journalists the it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters premise is declawed gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and at the screening of the movie everyone connected with the film goes nuts all without any repercussions lee certainly isnt bothered by any of the infantile outbursts in fact he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors hell no they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie all of which underscores how billy crystal and cowriter peter tolan screwed up their own premise the comedy in americas sweethearts is based on barelyincontrol people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters except that it doesnt matter because any publicity is good publicity and thus the very setup for the film implodes leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter so what about the cast julia roberts at her best playing the underdog is utterly charming here although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit and not a very convincing one by the way catherine zetajones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic by casting himself as the publicist billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on comic relief stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks in supporting roles hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed too broad seth green is amusing as a toadie stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair though he has little to work with come to think of it little to work with is the operative phrase for this movie as a hollywood satire americas sweethearts is toothless as a romance it is at best a minor pleasure such a good cast such a waste of their efforts had it not been taken long ago a better title for the film would have been much ado about nothing ',?
'note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their sciencefiction flick species squandering an intriguing premise the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success raking in over million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ben kingsleys a splendid actor but a marquee name he aint miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film i doubted that theyd dare tempt fate and go for another round so here comes species ii with a new creative team director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman respectively that fails to improve the series one iota like its predecessor species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid the film follows the exploits of a young man patrick ross justin lazard whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women loitering in strip clubs and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can in other words patrick is like a lot of guys these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age but theres a catch hes an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars and whos now infected with alien dna patricks overriding compulsion to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring and when he becomes aware of eve natasha henstridge a halfhuman halfalien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab patricks primary focus turns to her if these two were to mate the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable warns dr laura baker marg helgenberger gamely reprising her role with admirable conviction species ii opens with the mars mission and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokeylooking even splicing back to dated grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities they really skimped on production values this time around however this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy bmovie is quickly answered mr brancatos original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches like the first film and perhaps in homage to it theres a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitakers psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room something bad happened here this time laura gets to stand over a fresh shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter this is awful and shes not even empathic and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefullypaced suspense sequence eve whos telepathically linked to her alienhumanhybrid counterpart whatever helpfully tells our alienhunting protagonists hes going to rape her while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own theres an amusing tongueincheek bit of product placement which doesnt really make much sense but i appreciated the sentiment as well as some supermarketrelated hijinx hes in aisle informs eve if the film maintained this sort of lighthearted tone it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch but to its detriment it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody effectsladened anticlimactic conclusion much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense and there are such gaping plot holes that its terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief the implausibilities are endless what about the toxic bomb in eves brain why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual my favourite was the slowmotion sequence in the film where eve sporting superhuman strength is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief incredulous that its being foisted upon the public returning headlines michael madsen who reprises tough guy press lennox and ms helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay but theres realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis mykelti williamson portraying astronaut dennis gamble churns out an alltoofamiliar spin on a generic brashmouthed character and fine character actors george dzundza playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process and james cromwell patricks neglectful father senator ross are utterly wasted in the film mr lazard gives his character an appropriately shiftyeyed look while returning vixen ms henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene and acquits herself nicely but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing or none at all ms henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series claiming that shes so empowered a lethal halfalien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion now thats what i call empowerment ',?

'the generals daughter is a heartless absurd film a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with hamhanded obscenity creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudodepth whats worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess playing warrant officer paul brenner brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell leslie stefanson daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell brenner is teamed up with exspouse sarah sunderland madeline stowe and they check out all the suspects on the base including elizabeths mentor colonel moore james woods soon it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff but the question comes down to why and of course who eberts law of the economy of characters can be applied here one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point including the two protagonists but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that but its painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something on a story level the generals daughter is ineptly constructed the film adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demilles novel which was apparently based on a true story plods along to its conclusion filling in the blanks with stale unrealistic dialogue and shocking plot developments having not read the novel its difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity minutes after finding the dead young woman brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue which includes endless strings of forced lines sunderland actually asks brenner why was she killed to which i would have answered if i knew then the movie would already be over only after weve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together this angle though apparently present to develop their characters is never explored not that it really matters since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot in one scene sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask she sees one of his rings and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect they take him to brenners houseboat beat him up and pour hot coffee in his lap this scene really pushed me over the edge not because its gratuitous and meanspirited but because it illustrates the films complete disregard for the characters and the audience it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise i realized that these constructs on screen arent actually characters but devices present only to serve the story this would have been bad enough without the wests need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct compelling films about sexual crimes dont spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks and they certainly dont show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture these scenes are not the least bit powerful on the contrary theyre intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain whomever that may turn out to be in addition the movie treats sexual fetishes and sadomasochism in particular as if its a perversion of everything we know to be pure this standpoint is certainly allowed but only in accompaniment with welldeveloped themes to back it up as it is the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane perhaps the only positive elements in the generals daughter are a couple of the performances james woods has a few terrific scenes and plays his role with sharp witty subtlety i also liked james cromwell mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous nonetheless these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization the generals daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film it pretends to have a soul to be of strict moral code when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cutouts forcefeeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and onesided moral judgments ',?
'i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard the problem is i cant remember them as i write this review thats not a good sign in booty call jamie foxx is bunz a character whom i cant really describe because i dont know that much about him i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk and that he doesnt like relationships just booty calls at three in the morning no questions no commitment bunz has a best friend named rushon tommy davidson who seems to be bunzs direct opposite on the straight and narrow and currently in a longterm commitment a whole seven weeks wow rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend nikki tamala jones but for a reason which is not totally explained its going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikkis friend lysterine vivica a fox who have never met to make a long story short the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikkis obsession with safe sex first she wants condoms so bunz and rushon go out and get them oh no they have to be latex not lambskin back to the store now theyve got to get dental dams or therell be no foreplay why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand nikki phones lysterine who lives across the hall and tells her shed better be making these demands too talk about coitus interruptus booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those overthetop comedies the difference between the two is that in the latter things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality in this category for example you have ace ventura private eye on the mild side and airplane at the extreme there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention it is disappointing and even worse distracting there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker are those real names does not live up to its potential as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing for instance there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese much to everyones surprise however when asked how he learned the language he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from latenight kungfu films and soon gained mastery this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene if on the other hand when asked how he learned to speak chinese bunz simply replied with kungfu movies and then moved on the joke would have been much more effective this is because it would have been totally unbelievable but funny because we know it is unbelievable by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible the film is not giving its viewers enough credit the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex why doesnt she have some condoms at her own apartment these questions are not answered by the screenplay but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language some movies use a lot of swear words but use them under very justifiable circumstances as when they are employed consistent with a characters pattern of speech other films such as the recent jackie brown use them in ways that almost parody themselves booty call just sticks them in to get laughs and it doesnt work they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason the chinese restaurant a holdup at a convenience store and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story and are in there for filler this is surprising considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long its too bad that the core of the film isnt much better since it is comprised of sometimes funny but forgettable dialog i refer you to the first paragraph of this review ',?
'writerdirector lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the s yes thats right he cowrote raiders of the lost ark the empire strikes back and return of the jedi now with this film it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing and guess what he succeeds once again plot a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an openarmed swarm of people with problems it isnt long before he befriends the smalltown billionaire folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients critique this film is not a comedy it is a drama i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer you would think that this film secures its base in humor but unfortunately for us it does not it is a serious film seriously flawed if you ask me but i digress which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake but overall just sits there now on to my review this movie sucks because it was slow and boring starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst and certified it all with many a predictable ending i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture but whatever it was he missed anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puffpiece which on a good day might be described as predictably digestible its no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy it sucks as a drama and bored my movie cohort right to sleep ive given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks first of all i couldnt help but think about how much the lead actor loren dean looked like a young charles grodin he even acted like him save for the dry sardonic wit this kept me interested in watching him at least number two and this one is really shallow seemed to be geared that way as well there were quite a few titshots as they would say back in high school and god help me if i cant get enough of those in an aimless drama and three and this one surprised me the most actor ted dansons cameo yes he will always be sam malone to us real fans was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person a different asshole but a different person nonetheless if ever you rent this movie one day promise you wont throw away your hardearned money at the theaters wait for his scene because its actually pretty good other than that drab drab drab and drab even jason lee a personal favorite of mine was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while well at least he finally came out and did some real skateboarding in this movie oh yeah and i guess thats the fourth point in my rating anyway if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist this films your bag otherwise skip it and see analyze this again now theres a great shrink movie little known facts about this film and its stars threes company fans alert terri from the tv show also known as actress priscilla barnes plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage so stay tuned kids also it is to note that the actress was once named penthouse pet of the month in march of she was known as one joann witty back then shes originally from jersey who the hell is loren dean the dude who plays mumford in this film you got me but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in and played the character of billy bathgate in the film of the same name jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp hes been in every kevin smith film except for clerks listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince make a reference to the lost ark which is obviously an injoke considering that it is the writerdirector of this film lawrence kasdan who cowrote raiders of the lost ark kasdan also played the part of dr green in s as good as it gets ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdans directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt ',?
'i wont even pretend that i have seen the other alien films i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning sigourney weaver whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination plays the character of ripley  who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien years later scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley including the alien that was stuck inside her in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two yet ripley is now not completely human possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so but for now well just ignore it and move on why you ask would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated well the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research they yawn were wrong it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary unflossed teeth theres a little saying that goes something like this if youre going to make a bad film do it well  i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies but they are not the ones that really bother me alien resurrection a good example of a film that really gets up my nose is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore which attempts to distract us from the wanderingbutnotgoinganywhere plot in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story but this is unfortunately not the case and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film then you thought right one exciting scene is a credit and the only part remotely worth seeing to the film in which an alien chases two men one a cripple up a tall ladder with interesting results but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent its no wonder why alien resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is oh and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies  the less i enjoy a film the more i eat so all the lollies were gone in minutes but however empty the bag turned out to be it was still a long way ahead of the movie ',?
'a movie like mortal kombat annihilation works and must be reviewed on multiple levels first theres the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie but occasionaly almost as if making an ironic selfdepreciating remark the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery no no just kidding had you going there for a moment didnt i in all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it is necessary to provide two viewpoints that of a movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of a fan of the first movie andor a fan of the games the first movie mortal kombat concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth and its billion inhabitants the mortals won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth unfortunately shao khan was a poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready to take over the planet as our heroes assumed a fighting stance the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fans of the game id even go so far as to say that many folks who didnt know about the game probably enjoyed the movie the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they didnt try to overachieve there were a lot of really cool fight scenes with really cool accompanying music intersperesed with some distracting but ultimately nonintrusive bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot and as we know the movie was a smashing success at the box office mortal kombat annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie shao khan has decided that hes going to take over the earth anyways and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament thereafter follows approximately minutes of film that alternates between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought hey that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a real movie now too bad they didnt simply stick with the formula from the first movie i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture but here are the high points the acting is truly bad sandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie in one of the worst pieces of miscasting i think ive ever seen james remar plays raiden the god of thunder in the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics i generally like it when actors are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast as the president of the u s in the fifth element for example and remar has always been one of my favorite utility actors but hes so totally wrong for this part that he doesnt even have the luxury of amused selfawareness there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important but then never seen again there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks including a muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seeks out nightwolf litefoot has a mystical hallucination and then wanders off with jade irina pantaeva for these reasons and many others i can only give the movie a unless youre a huge fan of the games andor the first movie in that case the following critiques also apply sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing as a fighter wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts and puts together a much more believable fight scene in the fights each of the characters does at least one thing they do in the game and often more sonya does her kiss of death jax does his earthquake liu kang does his animality and so on a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely there arent as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between silly silly folks and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mudwrestling match lame and so obviously sexist even i politically incorrect for the most part noticed and remarked upon it the special effects are generally better except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their animalities motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games i give this a youll probably like it but not nearly as much as you liked the first one

' the beach is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder every forty minutes of this twohour film begins with a new theme virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment but then in the second act the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of blue lagoon forty minutes later the mood changes once more and it becomes a dumbed down version of lord of the flies where an isolated community is discovered where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs by the time its over you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about the main character of the beach is angstridden richard leonardo dicaprio he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if youre looking for a good time richards voiceover tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy robert carlisle he seems like a raving lunatic obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis though his jagged behavior would distress most of us richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen moreover the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life captivated by the idea he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richards once they finally arrive at this paradise however the mood of the story shifts to richards growing desire for francoise this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard etienne is about as exciting as fluffy white sand its odd that etienne never sees this coming but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view and once the three stumble across the hidden community mood shift imminent more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers for example there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark there are several ideas that are introduced in the beach and each one could merit its own featurelength film theres the man vs nature angle the love triangle angle and the utopiagoneawry angle but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred dicaprio as a result has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through consequently the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up ',?

impact bruce willis stars as harry stamper a famed oildriller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond zero barrier and destroys our planet why an oil driller they require someone experienced with deepcore mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid in one unintentionally hilarious sequence nasa asks harry to inspect a deepcore driller they built based on his own blueprints it is poorly constructedharry criticizes almost every aspect of it we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids harry assembles the obligatory ragtag bunch of cowboys including a blond guy a fat guy a black guy a wiseass and the man who is sleeping with his daughter affleck once they reach space we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrongperhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes whether or not they save the day i will not reveal nor will you care i will say this you know youre in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope willis has barely a chance to come alive ditto for affleck their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act in a last minuteand futileattempt to inject warmth into the material steve buscemis characterthe wiseassis exceptionally problematic rockhound as hes called is sarcastic and foolish so they tape him to a chair where he spends most of the film so why did they bring him up there to begin with rather why write him into the film give his almostwitty oneliners to serious willis who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig im guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel at least in my world where the sky is blue liv tyler is pretty and humourless as always suspiciously four of her fathers bands aerosmith songs grace the soundtrack director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick like ketchup eventually drowning the movie onscreen the middle hour is a nonsensical pyrotechnic assault on the average primates brain whenever someone dies in this movie a crew member inevitably yells out we lost insert dead persons last name here i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oilguycumastronaut from a live one and closeups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance as their skin was often covered in fake blood armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla it looks nicer and has fewer plotholes within its equally ludicrous framework it has a vivid soundmix but at almost twoandahalf hours i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story the love story has been played up in the ads perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanicfever bollocks the lovers in the film are miles apart throughouterase all thoughts of nude sketching or carsex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a mooncrawler remember a little film called jaws in this film three independentminded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark they didnt much like each other at first eventually they started to respect one another one of jaws great scenes involved the wouldbeahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories this is the sort of malebonding foreign to bay or his producer jerry bruckheimer who throw too many characters into the mix and expect well care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintancesid be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before action was called a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chestbeating bravery to this i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic nor brave nor smart even this team couldnt build a birdhouse and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailera trailer for a movie written by a team of bodybuilders and greeting card authorsive never been a prouder wimp my whole life ',?
'capsule this superlight situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television the characters are paperthin and the interesting ideas purely nonexistent this is a decrementlifebyminutes card to jalla jalla is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love the film is set in sweden where roro and mans fares fares and torkel petersson are custodians at a public park roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely mans is a swede from a much more liberal background they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park cleaning up after dogs roro and mans each have girlfriends but each has a problem roro nicknamed jalla is having family problems it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman yasmin laleh pourkarim but he is already in love with lisa tuva novotny yasmin likes roro but does not want to get married either mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other but then plan to break up before the wedding not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected the plot turns in several places are contrived one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen lebaneseborn josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer when things start to get slow he just adds throws in another story for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function we do see some of roros family life and his concerns that may be because roros background is a lot like that of the director while the story was entertaining i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film it was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this i rate it a on the to scale and a on the to scale ',?
'this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st elsewhere for several years and i had understood that the directorscreenwriter had written for the show on occasion also i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations nor were they satisfactory if i had to list a reason why but that would be getting ahead of myself besides its not immediately clear as there are so many problems with the film adam arkin plays a gradeschool teacher who is sardonic cynical and somewhat abrasive but a good teacher he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court one day he meets a drifter david morse who plays jack morrison on st elsewhere in the park and inveigles him in a game of oneonone basketball morse turns out to be good and a friendship slowly develops between the two as their respective professions progress on the screenarkins teaching and morses selling of paper flowers to passing motorists so far my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack good music to be sure but it doesnt replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the storyit makes the film somewhat minimalistic a technique i rarely admire suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morses introduction to a fellow teacher of arkins a woman arkin has long admired from afar but it too reticent to approach it appears that she begins to admire morse who enjoys here attentions but isnt sure what to do about itshe doesnt realize that he is a drifter and knows nothing about his past and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else until then i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a fullfledged failure the woman at least to me appeared to be fairly shallow i didnt realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse somehow this is made to appear as if it is arkins fault and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that hes gotten such a find of girlfriend frankly dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make punching her in the mouth not the least after this the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural if i had to summarize a major gripe its that this is a story spread too thin that creates semilikable characters at the outset and then suddenly jerks them into being yearolds at the last moment it might be truetolife with some people but that doesnt mean i have to like it i dont avoid ',?
'and i thought stigmata would be the worst religiouslyoriented thriller released this year turns out i was wrong because while stigmata was merely boring and selfimportant end of days is completely inept on all fronts its a silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best its extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up for the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin doesnt count is no fun at all end of days is a major stinker the movie opens in vatican city some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation if he impregnates her between and midnight on december the world will be destroyed the pope orders protection of this girl though some priests believe she ought to be killed in new york that very night a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy twenty years later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger a suicidal excop with a drinking problem now working as a security guard for hire he is protecting a local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed by the devil an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her there are so many problems with this film its hard to know where to begin but how about starting with the concept casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with schwarzenegger is a persona not an actor so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions in other words trying to give him dimension was a mistake harrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role theyve all played noble and flawed heroes but not schwarzenegger there are several scenes that attempt to establish jerichos character one has him contemplating suicide another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christines location by offering him his old life back none of these scenes really work because arnie isnt up to the task the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong confident character like the terminator for example the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before this one isnt at all believable the way arnold plays him the supporting cast tries their hardest and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all as the prince of darkness hes suave and confident he acts like one would expect the devil to act the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him as a powerful villain byrne outperforms arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable root for the devil byrnes speech about the bible being overrated actually starts to make sense mainly because arnolds attempts at refuting it mostly of the tis not variety are feeble at best the only problem is arnold has to win so in the end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides but like most bad action movie sidekicks he disappears after about an hour robin tunney isnt given much to do except look scared in fact all of the supporting players are good actors but none save for byrne is given anything interesting to do performances aside it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it this being an action blockbuster its no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script which starts off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is its utterly ridiculous why is the devil coming on new years eve because its exactly years after the year of the devil which isnt it turns out some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is so just add a to the beginning and youve got if you dont buy this explanation youre not alone its convoluted and silly at the same time the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous shes christine see and she lives in new york see and if that werent bad enough theres plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isnt explained at all why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk excop hes powerless is he impervious to only one kind of bullet how come he cant control jericho or christine and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this but its never actually explained usually this sort of thing wouldnt matter in a schwarzenegger flick i mean dont get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting there are several predictable horror film clich s present in end of days complete with the old black cat hiding in a cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there it gets so formulaic that its possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a boo will come their predictions will rarely be wrong the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless partially because we dont care about these characters due to the scripts pathetic attempts at characterization and setup and also because they too dont make any sense theres a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady its good for a few chuckles but not much else supposedly were to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan but the script never sets that up so the scene is merely silly none of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequences are so badly framed that its often hard to tell why its happening in the first place not to mention that theyre edited in fullon incomprehensible mtv quickcut style most of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool end of days is not only silly and confusing but its also distinctly unpleasant to watch the devil apparently doesnt operate in the more subtle illconvincepeopletokilleachother fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight this doesnt only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also means that not a single scene in end of days goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head if violence is supposed to be shocking its not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb scenes arent connected through any reasonable means so a lot of the time stuff gets blown up or people get killed and i had no idea why reasons to hell with reasons lets just blow stuff up isnt it cool nope not by a long shot this film is thoroughly unwatchable its dull interminable and unrelenting in its stupidity perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career because its not happening with hack peter hyams here end of days might have had camp value if only it didnt top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobodys going to buy if the movie is going to be serious the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script if its going to be campy arnold shouldnt be taking himself so damn seriously i didnt actually see him put up on a cross did i and his character shouldnt be such a sad sack as it stands end of days is just a bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that ',?
'so ask yourself what mm eight millimeter is really all about is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography is it about the business itself how bubbling just beneath the surface of bigtown americana theres a sordid world of sick and depraved people who wont necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires or is it about those who can those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see im not talking about snuff films supposed documentaries of victims being brutalized and killed on camera im talking about films like mm and its director joel schumacher with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit batman robin a time to kill batman forever the client schumacher certainly has that kind of influence is mm something you really want to see probably not the first twothirds of mm unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama albeit with a particularly unsavory core then as its been threatening all along the film explodes into violence and just when you think its finally over schumacher tags on a ridiculous selfrighteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further trust me there are better ways to waste two hours of your life nicolas snake eyes cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husbands safe documents a young girls murder welles goes about his assignment rather matteroffactly and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly almost as if you dont need any specialized skills or training to do this welles certainly makes it look easy and cops obviously never look in toilet tanks for clues the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes like george c scott in paul schraders hardcore occasionally a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector reminding him of his unpleasant task there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife played by catherine keener who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly splitlevel home in harrisburg pa mm doesnt condemn or condone its subject matter it just exploits it the irony of course is that schumacher and seven scribe andrew kevin walkers vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an rrated firstrun hollywood product so we only see snippets of snuff and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror later its the turn of joaquin phoenix whos quite good and by far the films most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again all this to get to the familiar yet offensive revelation that sexual deviants are not indeed monsters but everyday people like you and me neither super nor standard mm is shocking only in its banality ',?
'dont let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work and this movie makes a vain attempt at that any moves to glamorise his life which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness this movie about his life although well written puts too much makeup on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes rather than lobster and champagne oh well lets fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious playwrite who falls in love with a beautiful woman gwyneth paltrow and from her inspiration several plays develop romeo and juliet and the twelfth night it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and thats how all his plays develop but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama but i guess my version probably wouldnt draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul i think not as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie i think not in many aspects private ryan and life is beautiful were far superior movies but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar as time and again for reasons unexplained an undeserving movie will win the accolade another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead over a more polished cate but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised people will start feeling sorry for you ',?
